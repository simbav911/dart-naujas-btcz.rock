Over the past decade, large players and centralized entities have dominated the market, sometimes altering token supplies or imposing high fees that disproportionately affect everyday users. Recent innovations, however—particularly in Layer 2 (L2) solutions—are paving the way for a more equitable future in crypto. One standout project in this movement is BitcoinZ (BTCZ), a highly decentralized and community-driven cryptocurrency with a fixed supply of 21 billion coins.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BitcoinZ listed in Changelly</title><link>/en/news/2024-04-19-bitcoinz-listed-in-changelly/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/news/2024-04-19-bitcoinz-listed-in-changelly/</guid><description>&lt;p>BitcoinZ Community has made it again!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Even better prospect lies ahead for BitcoinZ in the near future as some milestones for its development have been just delivered by its growing Community recently:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A critical target of its updated 2022-2023 Roadmap has been completed withConnect-Za Gateway where the users are able to swap native BitcoinZ coins to tokenized BitcoinZ (wBTCZ) with 1:1 ratio as BitcoinZ’s maximum supply is immutable.

&lt;p>The user can now turn native BTCZ coins to same number of tokenized BTCZ (wBTCZ) that are released in the Binance Smart Chain. The ratio is 1:1 and the native coins are automatically locked in the Gateway since the maximum supply of BTCZ is immutable. In the same way, a user is able to change back wBTCZ for native BTCZ. In this scenario, the wBTCZ tokens are automatically burnt in order to unlock BTCZ in the native BitcoinZ blockchain.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BitcoinZ the top coin to mine after Ethereum’s Merge</title><link>/en/news/2022-09-15-bitcoinz-the-top-coin-to-mine-after-ethereum-s-merge/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/news/2022-09-15-bitcoinz-the-top-coin-to-mine-after-ethereum-s-merge/</guid><description>&lt;p>The so called Ethereum’s “Merge” is here.Ethereum,  the currently most popular mineable Proof of Work cryptocurrency network, is switching to the Proof of Stake protocol for a series of reasons so it ceases to be “mineable” by Computers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You can check the statuses of the services that such platforms use (like the explorers) and see if they are online or not.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The coin attracted  many new buyers and enters a very “hot” period with its Community gaining new members every day&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which are the reasons behind this extreme move ?&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The fact that BITCOINZ is atrue crypto assetthat acts asa hedge against inflation.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This comes in total constrast with the “trending” Defi platforms. The Defi platforms that recently became viral in the cryptocurrency world, have aninflativeeffect as they make the creation of new (mostly scam) tokens extremely easy. These tokens became too many and are all depending on centralized heavily premined blockchains. For example ETH is a 70% premined project with gas fees that touch numbers of even $170 dollars or higher and aconstantly increasingmax supply.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Z-Brain Meeting : 22 January 22</title><link>/en/news/2022-01-05-z-brain-meeting-22-january-22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/news/2022-01-05-z-brain-meeting-22-january-22/</guid><description>&lt;p>The date forthe next Z-Brain Meeting: 22-January-2022.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Of course we all know that BITCOINZ is a community driven project with no free funds coming from premine or ICO, since all its supply is distributed to the community members with the mining process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is why the BITCOINZ ecosystem and its user base has an organic growth without the easy but most times dirty job of influencers or other marketing tricks. Most times this leads to very surprising results, with useless tokens being advertised as something important and pure cryptocurrency networks growing silently without the top exchanges ever noticing them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BITCOINZ TRADING VOLUME RECORD!</title><link>/en/news/2021-12-12-bitcoinz-trading-volume-record/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/news/2021-12-12-bitcoinz-trading-volume-record/</guid><description>&lt;p>BITCOINZ trading volume hits all time record!

&lt;p>The blockchain has reached theBlock 8400000 today on 31-Oct-21 and it is on Halloween and on the date when the white paper of the classic Bitcoin had been released!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What a crazy coincidence!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because actually the exact date for a certain block of a Proof of Work network cannot be predicted with high accuracy. Since the block times for each block is just an average. This is why many members had been asking about the countdown changes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ArmyZ Frequently Asked Questions</title><link>/en/news/2021-10-22-armyz-frequently-asked-questions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/news/2021-10-22-armyz-frequently-asked-questions/</guid><description>&lt;p>1)What exactly is ArmyZand why should I join it?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>What is BITCOINZ-DEX exactly?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>BITCOINZ-DEX is an innovative application that acts as wallet with integrated DEX functionality using BITCOINZ as one of its basic digital currencies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In reality the user can enjoy a modern wallet app , owning his keys for every asset and at the same time atrue 100% Decentralized Exchangethat enables the users totrade directly (P2P)between them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Utilizing the Komodo’s atomic swap technology, it shares the same liquidity with every other true DEX that is based on the same model! It is among the very fewTrue DEXplatforms that give swapping functionality between (potentially)allthe unique UTXO blockchainsandthe eth  tokens or other tokenizing ecosystems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BITCOINZ Skyrockets…but why?</title><link>/en/news/2021-09-15-bitcoinz-skyrockets-but-why/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/news/2021-09-15-bitcoinz-skyrockets-but-why/</guid><description>&lt;p>BITCOINZ skyrocketed up to +77% during a negative day for the cryptocurrency market.Many people wonder why this impressive move took place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obviously the coin attracted many buyers and enters a very “hot” period with its Community gaining new members every day!.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which are the reasons behind this extreme move ?&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The fact that BITCOINZ is a deflationary asset in constrast the “trending” Defi platforms. The Defi platforms that recently became viral in the cryptocurrency world have aninflativeeffect as they make the creation of new (mostly scam) tokens extremely easy. These tokens became too many and are all depending on centralized heavily premined blockchains. For example ETH is a 70% premined project with gas fees that touch numbers of even $170 dollars or higher and aconstantly increasingmax supply.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In contrast, BitcoinZ had no central authority issuing or distributing coins according to a founder’s wish (noICO sales, nopremine) and has a fixedmaximum supplythat will never change. It fulfills this way all the five fundamentals that define the very essence of a realcryptocurrency.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BITCOINZ Birthday Party in India!</title><link>/en/news/2021-09-14-bitcoinz-birthday-party-in-india/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/news/2021-09-14-bitcoinz-birthday-party-in-india/</guid><description>&lt;p>Birthday Cake!
