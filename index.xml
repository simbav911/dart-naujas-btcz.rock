&lt;p>A critical target of its updated 2022-2023 Roadmap has been completed withConnect-Za Gateway where the users are able to swap native BitcoinZ coins to tokenized BitcoinZ (wBTCZ) with 1:1 ratio as BitcoinZ’s maximum supply is immutable.

&lt;p>The user can now turn native BTCZ coins to same number of tokenized BTCZ (wBTCZ) that are released in the Binance Smart Chain. The ratio is 1:1 and the native coins are automatically locked in the Gateway since the maximum supply of BTCZ is immutable. In the same way, a user is able to change back wBTCZ for native BTCZ. In this scenario, the wBTCZ tokens are automatically burnt in order to unlock BTCZ in the native BitcoinZ blockchain.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mining Network Milestone</title><link>/roadmap/2022-09-16-mining-milestone/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/roadmap/2022-09-16-mining-milestone/</guid><description>BitcoinZ achieves significant mining network growth and stability</description></item><item><title>Top Mining Cryptocurrency Post-Ethereum Merge</title><link>/roadmap/2022-09-16-ethereum-merge-mining/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/roadmap/2022-09-16-ethereum-merge-mining/</guid><description>BitcoinZ emerges as the top mineable coin following the Ethereum Merge</description></item><item><title>BitcoinZ the top coin to mine after Ethereum’s Merge</title><link>/en/news/2022-09-15-bitcoinz-the-top-coin-to-mine-after-ethereum-s-merge/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/news/2022-09-15-bitcoinz-the-top-coin-to-mine-after-ethereum-s-merge/</guid><description>&lt;p>The so called Ethereum’s “Merge” is here.Ethereum,  the currently most popular mineable Proof of Work cryptocurrency network, is switching to the Proof of Stake protocol for a series of reasons so it ceases to be “mineable” by Computers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The users can trade with the #LTCpair which grants them next to zero fees and much tighter spreads than BTC.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>TradeOgre was established in 2018 and has concentrated in privacy coins. It reports its volume to platforms like Coinmarketcap, Gecko, Whattomine and of course to Nomics and CoinPaprika. The US residents can use the exchange and there is no KYC procedure required for withdrawals, making TradeOgre one of the top exchanges respecting the user’s anonymity and freedom.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BITCOINZ Skyrocketing – Now in top gainers</title><link>/en/news/2022-01-11-bitcoinz-skyrocketing-now-in-top-gainers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/news/2022-01-11-bitcoinz-skyrocketing-now-in-top-gainers/</guid><description>&lt;p>BITCOINZ is skyrocketing! Despite the recent bloodbath for the most cryptocurrencies, BTCZ is among the top gainers with a record 24h volume of more than  $ 1,000,000.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The coin attracted  many new buyers and enters a very “hot” period with its Community gaining new members every day&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which are the reasons behind this extreme move ?&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The fact that BITCOINZ is atrue crypto assetthat acts asa hedge against inflation.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This comes in total constrast with the “trending” Defi platforms. The Defi platforms that recently became viral in the cryptocurrency world, have aninflativeeffect as they make the creation of new (mostly scam) tokens extremely easy. These tokens became too many and are all depending on centralized heavily premined blockchains. For example ETH is a 70% premined project with gas fees that touch numbers of even $170 dollars or higher and aconstantly increasingmax supply.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Z-Brain Meeting : 22 January 22</title><link>/en/news/2022-01-05-z-brain-meeting-22-january-22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/news/2022-01-05-z-brain-meeting-22-january-22/</guid><description>&lt;p>The date forthe next Z-Brain Meeting: 22-January-2022.&lt;/p>

Yes we can make this !&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many Community members had been asking “why BITCOINZ is not listed in one of the very top exchanges?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course we all know that BITCOINZ is a community driven project with no free funds coming from premine or ICO, since all its supply is distributed to the community members with the mining process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is why the BITCOINZ ecosystem and its user base has an organic growth without the easy but most times dirty job of influencers or other marketing tricks. Most times this leads to very surprising results, with useless tokens being advertised as something important and pure cryptocurrency networks growing silently without the top exchanges ever noticing them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BitcoinZ Media Outreach Campaign</title><link>/roadmap/2021-12-12-press-releases/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/roadmap/2021-12-12-press-releases/</guid><description>Launching a series of press releases through EIN PressWire to expand project visibility</description></item><item><title>BITCOINZ TRADING VOLUME RECORD!</title><link>/en/news/2021-12-12-bitcoinz-trading-volume-record/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/news/2021-12-12-bitcoinz-trading-volume-record/</guid><description>&lt;p>BITCOINZ trading volume hits all time record!

&lt;p>Utilizing the Komodo’s atomic swap technology, it shares the same liquidity with every other true DEX that is based on the same model!

&lt;p>Obviously the coin attracted many buyers and enters a very “hot” period with its Community gaining new members every day!.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which are the reasons behind this extreme move ?&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The fact that BITCOINZ is a deflationary asset in constrast the “trending” Defi platforms. The Defi platforms that recently became viral in the cryptocurrency world have aninflativeeffect as they make the creation of new (mostly scam) tokens extremely easy. These tokens became too many and are all depending on centralized heavily premined blockchains. For example ETH is a 70% premined project with gas fees that touch numbers of even $170 dollars or higher and aconstantly increasingmax supply.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In contrast, BitcoinZ had no central authority issuing or distributing coins according to a founder’s wish (noICO sales, nopremine) and has a fixedmaximum supplythat will never change. It fulfills this way all the five fundamentals that define the very essence of a realcryptocurrency.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BITCOINZ Birthday Party in India!</title><link>/en/news/2021-09-14-bitcoinz-birthday-party-in-india/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/news/2021-09-14-bitcoinz-birthday-party-in-india/</guid><description>&lt;p>Birthday Cake!

&lt;p>Obviously the coin, against the bearish trend, attracted many buyers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which are the reasons behind this extreme move ?&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The fact that BITCOINZ is a deflationary asset in constrast the “trending” Defi platforms. The Defi platforms that became viral in the cryptocurrency world during the last couple of years have an inflative effect as they make the creation of new (mostly scam) tokens extremely easy. These tokens became too many and are all depending on centralized heavily premined blockchains. ETH is a 70% premined project with fees that touch numbers of even $170 dollars or higher and a constantly increasing max supply.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In contrast, BitcoinZ had no central authority issuing or distributing coins according to a founder’s wish (ICO sales, premine and other techniques) and has a fixed maximum supply that will never change. It fulfills this way all the five fundamentals that define the very essence of a real cryptocurrency.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BITCOINZ wins the DOGEDEX listing poll!</title><link>/en/news/2021-04-20-bitcoinz-wins-the-dogedex-listing-poll/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/news/2021-04-20-bitcoinz-wins-the-dogedex-listing-poll/</guid><description>&lt;p>BITCOINZ won easily the DOGEDEX listing poll!&lt;/p>
