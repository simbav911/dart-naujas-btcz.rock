## What is the BitcoinZ Halving?

The BitcoinZ halving is a significant event in the cryptocurrency's lifecycle where the mining reward is reduced by 50%. This mechanism is built into the protocol to control inflation and ensure the scarcity of BTCZ over time.

### Why is Halving Important?

1. **Controls Inflation**: By reducing the rate at which new coins are created
2. **Increases Scarcity**: Makes BitcoinZ more scarce over time
3. **Follows Bitcoin's Model**: Similar to Bitcoin's halving mechanism
4. **Potential Price Impact**: Historically, halvings have preceded price increases in other cryptocurrencies

### BitcoinZ Halving Schedule

- **First Halving**: October 2021 - Reward reduced from 12,500 to 6,250 BTCZ
- **Second Halving**: Expected December 2025 - Reward will reduce to 3,125 BTCZ
- **Future Halvings**: Will continue approximately every 4 years
