# BitcoinZ Community Transparency

## Our Commitment to Transparency

At BitcoinZ, we believe in complete transparency in how we generate and utilize community funds. This page provides real-time insights into our revenue streams and spending patterns.

## Why We Use Ads

BitcoinZ uses carefully placed advertisements to fund community initiatives without relying on donations or taxes. Here's how it works:

### Community-Driven Funding
Instead of relying on donations or taxes, we leverage existing website traffic to fund BitcoinZ's growth. Every click directly supports community-voted initiatives such as educational content, influencer partnerships, and multilingual guides.

### Non-Intrusive Design
We maintain a balance between generating revenue and user experience:
- Ads are limited to three units per page
- Ads are placed in positions that do not disrupt navigation or content consumption
- All ad placements are reviewed by the community

### Revenue Allocation
All advertising revenue is distributed according to community-voted initiatives:
- 40% Educational Content Development
- 30% Marketing and Outreach
- 20% Technical Infrastructure
- 10% Community Events and Rewards
