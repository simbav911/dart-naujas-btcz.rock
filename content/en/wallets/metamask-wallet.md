## Important Notice

**This wallet only supports wrapped BitcoinZ (wBTCZ) on Binance Smart Chain, not native BitcoinZ!**

For the authentic BitcoinZ experience with maximum privacy, security, and decentralization, we recommend using native BitcoinZ wallets like the Full Node Wallet, Coinomi, or ZelCore.

## Understanding Wrapped BitcoinZ (wBTCZ)

### What is Wrapped BitcoinZ?
Wrapped BitcoinZ (wBTCZ) is a token on the Binance Smart Chain that represents BitcoinZ. It's a 1:1 representation of BTCZ on the BSC network, allowing for interaction with BSC's ecosystem.

Contract Address: `0xcBBB3e5099F769F6d4E2b8b92DC0e268f7E099D8`

### Key Differences from Native BTCZ
- Runs on Binance Smart Chain, not the BitcoinZ network
- Depends on BSC network status and fees
- Lacks native BTCZ privacy features
- Centralization risks from BSC
- Different security model

## The Bridge System

### How the Bridge Works
1. Visit https://bridge.btcz.rocks/
2. Connect your MetaMask wallet
3. Lock BTCZ on the native network
4. Receive wBTCZ on BSC
5. Reverse process to return to native BTCZ

### Bridge Considerations
- Technical knowledge required
- Understanding of cross-chain operations needed
- Transaction fees on both networks
- Potential bridge downtime
- Smart contract risks

## Why Use Wrapped BTCZ?

### Advantages
- Access to BSC DeFi ecosystem
- Lower BSC transaction fees
- Faster BSC confirmations
- Smart contract functionality
- DApp integration

### Disadvantages
- Less privacy than native BTCZ
- Dependent on BSC network
- Additional complexity
- Bridge risks
- Less decentralized

## MetaMask Setup for wBTCZ

### Initial Setup
1. Install MetaMask from https://metamask.io/
2. Create or import wallet
3. Add Binance Smart Chain network
4. Add wBTCZ token contract
5. Ensure sufficient BNB for fees

### Adding wBTCZ Token
1. Click "Import Token"
2. Select "Custom Token"
3. Enter contract: 0xcBBB3e5099F769F6d4E2b8b92DC0e268f7E099D8
4. Confirm token details
5. Click "Add Token"

## Security Considerations

### Risk Factors
- Smart contract vulnerabilities
- Bridge security dependencies
- BSC network risks
- Private key management
- Phishing attempts

### Best Practices
1. Verify all addresses carefully
2. Start with small amounts
3. Understand the risks involved
4. Keep security updates current
5. Use hardware wallet when possible

## Expert Recommendations

### When to Use wBTCZ
- DeFi participation
- BSC ecosystem integration
- Smart contract interaction
- Lower fee requirements
- Cross-chain operations

### When to Use Native BTCZ
- Maximum privacy needed
- True decentralization required
- Long-term holding
- Direct peer-to-peer transfers
- Privacy-focused transactions

## Support and Resources

- MetaMask documentation
- Bridge documentation
- BSC guides
- Community support
- Technical assistance

Remember: Wrapped BitcoinZ on BSC is an advanced feature for experienced users. For typical transactions and maximum security, we recommend using native BitcoinZ wallets. The wrapped version sacrifices some of BitcoinZ's core benefits (privacy, decentralization, security) for BSC ecosystem access and should be used cautiously.
