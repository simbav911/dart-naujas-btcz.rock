    description: "While this video questions BitcoinZ's legitimacy, it's important to note that true decentralization, which BitcoinZ embodies, is the antithesis of a scam. BitcoinZ was launched fairly, with no pre-mine, no ICO, and no developer taxes - making it one of the most decentralized cryptocurrencies in existence. We welcome open discussion and encourage viewers to research our transparent, community-driven approach."
