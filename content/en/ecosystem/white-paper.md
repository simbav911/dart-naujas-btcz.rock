# BitcoinZ - A Community Gift to the World {.text-btcz-gold}

## Introduction
BitcoinZ is a cryptocurrency born from a fair and decentralized vision—one that emphasizes freedom, inclusivity, and community-driven development. Officially launched on September 9, 2017, BitcoinZ was presented as a gift to humanity, inviting everyone to participate in the coin's growth and governance without any central authority or predetermined advantage. This foundational ethos ensures that BitcoinZ remains a coin truly by the people, for the people.

## Founding Principles
- **Decentralized Development:** All improvements and decisions emerge from open community discussions.  
- **Fair Launch:** No pre-mining, no initial coin offering (ICO), and no developer taxes. Every coin in circulation is generated through the mining process available to all.  
- **Immutable History:** The blockchain history cannot be altered. Hard forks occur only to improve functionality, never to rewrite the ledger's past.  
- **Equal Opportunity Mining:** By utilizing an ASIC-resistant Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm, BitcoinZ ensures anyone with a standard graphics processing unit (GPU) can mine, reducing barriers to entry.  
- **Liberty and Inclusivity:** Everyone, regardless of background, is welcome. The goal of providing 21 billion coins seeks to offer at least one BitcoinZ to every person on the planet.

## Code of Conduct
The BitcoinZ community is founded on mutual respect, integrity, and positive contribution. The following behaviors are not tolerated:
- Discrimination or insults based on race, ethnicity, religious beliefs, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, or cultural traits.
- Fraudulent, harmful, or illegal activities under the BitcoinZ name.
- Behavior that damages the public image of BitcoinZ or that disrupts community channels.

We encourage everyone to treat each other with dignity and understanding. As a global and decentralized community, BitcoinZ's strength lies in constructive dialogue, learning, and cooperation.

## Technical Overview
BitcoinZ is built on a Zcash-based core, incorporating Bitcoin's fundamental principles. It leverages the Equihash algorithm and zk-SNARK technology to provide both transparent and anonymous transaction capabilities, safeguarding user privacy. The combination of these technologies ensures:
- **Transparent and Private Transactions:** Users can choose between standard t-addresses for transparency or z-addresses for enhanced privacy.
- **Equihash PoW:** A memory-hard algorithm designed to favor commodity hardware (GPUs), preventing centralization by specialized mining hardware.
- **Long-Term Sustainability:** With a total supply of 21 billion coins and a halving schedule every ~4 years, BitcoinZ maintains a controlled issuance rate that supports long-term, fair distribution.

## Monetary Policy and Halving Schedule
The initial block reward is set at 12,500 BTCZ per block, with a halving interval of every 840,000 blocks. Given the approximate 2.5-minute block time, a halving occurs roughly every four years. At the time of the first halving, half of the total supply (around 10.5 billion BTCZ) will be distributed. This model mirrors the established and proven approach of Bitcoin's halving cycle, ensuring gradual issuance and reduced inflation over time.

## Community Governance and Proposals
BitcoinZ's development roadmap and feature set are influenced by community proposals. These proposals are categorized based on their impact and complexity:

### Tier 1 – Core Use Cases
Proposals seeking to add new core functionalities or significantly alter existing structures must undergo extensive community scrutiny. After an open comment period, they are subjected to a formal vote. A 55% majority is required for acceptance.

### Tier 2 – Other Use Cases
Initiatives related to marketing, infrastructure, exchange listings, or community events are proposed through open forums and voted on by the community. These require a 70% majority approval.

### Tier 3 – Emergencies & Reallocation
In urgent or unforeseen circumstances, designated community members may allocate funds to ensure the stability or security of the network. Unused approved funds can also be reallocated if a similar community-approved initiative arises.

## Decentralized Techniques and Participation
BitcoinZ's decentralized structure is reinforced through collective efforts. The community is encouraged to:
- Spread awareness through social media, community groups, or educational content.
- Develop tools, wallets, and block explorers to enrich the ecosystem.
- Create multiple websites, resource hubs, and platforms—ensuring no single point of control exists.
- Establish and maintain diverse mining pools, decentralizing the network's computational power.

## Supporting Infrastructure and Activities
The community's contributions may include running wallet nodes, participating in code development, translating guides, and fostering international outreach. Every member's involvement, whether technical or promotional, strengthens BitcoinZ's mission. Together, the community forms a global team committed to freedom, inclusivity, and innovation.

## Technical Glossary
- **BitcoinZ Daemon/Wallet:** Software that allows users to send, receive, and store BTCZ, and synchronize with the blockchain.
- **Block Height:** A reference number for each block in the blockchain. The first block (genesis block) is at height zero.
- **Blockchain Explorer:** A tool for viewing the blockchain's data, including transactions and block confirmations.
- **DNS Seeder:** A system that helps wallets and nodes find reliable peers on the network.
- **Mining Pools:** Groups of miners who combine their computing power to solve blocks more frequently, sharing the rewards proportionally.
- **Proof of Work (PoW):** A consensus algorithm that ensures new blocks are valid, requiring computational work to prevent malicious or spammy behavior.
- **zk-SNARKs:** Cryptographic proofs that enable private transactions, allowing one party to prove a transaction's validity without revealing the underlying details.

## Conclusion
BitcoinZ stands as a testament to what a community-powered, decentralized cryptocurrency can achieve. It blends the best parts of Bitcoin's philosophy, Zcash's technological innovations, and the inclusive spirit of open participation. Guided by core principles—decentralization, fairness, and freedom—BitcoinZ continues to evolve as its global community shapes its future. The journey is open to anyone who wishes to join, contribute, and benefit from a truly democratic digital currency ecosystem.

Welcome to BitcoinZ. It is, and always will be, a gift to the world.
