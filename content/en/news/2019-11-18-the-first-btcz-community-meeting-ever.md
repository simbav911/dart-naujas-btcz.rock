The first BTCZ Community Meeting  ever  (in Real life and Not online!) took place on 16-17 November 2019 in ROME! Our members had the chance to meet each other and discuss about the recent advancements in the BTCZ Ecosystem and new ideas for the Project.

Special Regards to the members who organized this unique event and of course those who traveled to Rome in order to support it and be there!
