BitcoinZ Community has released thefirst videofrom the new BTCZ video series.

It came after theteaserthat was released a couple of days earlier.

It is a promotional and informative video that is already available in the Community’sYoutube channel. The central idea behind it, is to make crystal clear why BitcoinZ is using the name of the classic Bitcoin.

This happens because BitcoinZ implemented all the good elements ofBitcoinwithout being its chainfork! BitcoinZ had its very owngenesis blockand many completely new characteristics liek privacy, ultra low fees, faster transactions,ASICresistant mining algorithm and more.

Many people when see the “Bitcoin” in anothercryptocurrency‘s name , they automatically think that it is a chainfork. A project that aidropped free coins to BTC owners and that it was just an easy copy that tried to take advantage of the free exposure with the chain-fork.

This is quite true for manycryptocurrenciesbut obsiously it doesn’t happen for BitcoinZ. Enjoy the full video that presents all the benefits that BitcoinZ has offered to the world, keeping at the same time all the great characteristics of Bitcoin, like the P2PPoWapproach, the anonymous launch, the zeropremine, the lack ofICO salesand dev taxes.
