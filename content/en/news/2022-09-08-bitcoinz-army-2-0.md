An army of active people in social media that will fight for spreading the originalcryptocurrencyidea.

This was concept of  the BitcoinZ Army aka “Army-Z” project as people could help in this enjoying some coin rewards coming from the Community’s Vault.

This way,BitcoinZ became the first Proof of Work pure cryptocurrency that enables someone to earn coins even without mining equipment, with a stable pace outside the boundaries of any competition.

BITCOINZ Community has beendistinguished all these years for its high level of engagement. A cryptocurrency without active community members is a dead cryptocurrency.

We can see countless projects that try to build an image of “strong” social media profiles with many thousands of followers. However the vast majority of them usefake followersthat are bought in packages, with zero interaction.

In BitcoinZ we do things in a different way with 100% organic growth in social media.

So which are the differences now with BitcoinZ Army 2.0 version?

BitcoinZ Army 2.0 is the next level of the revolutionary Army-Z idea.

It was planned after the in-depth analysis of all the Army-Z concept’s flaws.

The general idea is to cease having a “black or white” , “Army-Z or not Army-Z member” dual situation. Because obviously there are members that have different level of activity: from members that are extremely active to members that are elementary active because they don’t have much time or even some people who possibly try to abuse the mechanism just in order to receive rewards and rarely help the project.

With Army-Z 2.0 , we have a much more sophisticated structure with medallions which are related to ranks/levels and even higher coin rewards.

The user is able to join Army-Z and get the basic “Army-Z member’s” medal after a relatively easy review of his associated social media Twitter account and then advance to higher ranks by gaining more medals.

How exactly a member can gain a higher rank?

We are going to have two different categories of medals, that are called functions, depending on what kind of activity a member has.

For members who support the Project in social media platforms there are the Social Media medals : Fighter’s → Knight’s → Veteran’s

For members who create content such as artworks, animations, youtube videos, articles etc there are the Content Creation medals : Enchanter’s → Magician’s → Archmage’s

Finally there is a special General’s medal that is granted to the Community’s social media administrators who are also BitcoinZ army’s supervisors.

Each medal/rank has a relevant pool with weekly rewards that are distributed every Friday exclusively to the members that have these medals/ranks.

For example the Army-Z “basic” members have access to the Army-Z members’ rewards that are 10,000 BTCZ coins per week.

The Army-Z Fighters have access to the Fighters’ rewards that are 15,000 BTCZ per week, the Army-Z Knights have access to the Knights’ rewards that are 17,500 BTCZ per week and so on.

In order to advance to a next level/rank , a member has to fulfill the relevant requirements and to first have acquired all the previous ones in the same “chain”.

A Fighter has to first be an Army-Z member.

A Knight has to first be a Fighter and so on.

So a Fighter is included in both the Army-Z members’ list and in the Fighters’ list, receiving rewards from both of these pools of rewards every week.

In the same way, a Knight is included in all the three lists of Army-Z members, Fighters and Knights (since he has all these three medals) and he is receiving rewards from all these associated pools of rewards.

Obviously, as the requirements are higher for each rank , the list with the members that are eligible to receive a higher rank’s rewards are less and the rewards are much better. In contrast, a single Army-Z member is in a much more populated list , sharing the weekly rewards with many more other people.

The requirements for each rank can be found in the Medallion/Ranks Analysis table above and a general decription can be found in the card below.

How can a member join the BitcoinZ Army 2.0 with simple steps ?

The steps are the same with  the classic ArmyZ concept and it is very easy,  :

1) Just join theBITCOINZ Discord server. There you will add your social media profile(s), with which you intend to support the Project, in the#joinarmyz-getfollowers subchannel.In this list you can follow other members in order to help make their profiles stronger, with more followers, like they will do back for you.

2) Share the recent posts of theOfficial BitcoinZ Community Twitter profilein your twitter, just ask the moderators in the BTCZ Discord toadd you in the ArmyZ. (they would do it anyway after checking your twitter profile)
