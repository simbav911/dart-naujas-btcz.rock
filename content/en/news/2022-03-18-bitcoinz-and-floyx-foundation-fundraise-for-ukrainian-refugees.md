The BitcoinZ Community supportsFloyxFoundationfundraising to help Ukrainian refugees in Poland.

Already 1 Million BTCZ have been sent from our Community’s charity Fund.

Let’s all do our best in order to bring a smile to innocent children’s faces.

Everyonecan scan this QR code and send some BTCZ coins in order help the Foundation to buy blankets, pampers, food & more.

(The coins will be bought back from investors who wish to buy BitcoinZ spending FIAT providing the needed FIAT liquidity for this noble cause).

More news will come soon after the first prepared packages. Thank you all in advance for your kind gestures & congratulations to Floyx Foundation for this great initiative!
