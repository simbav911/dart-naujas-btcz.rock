BitcoinZ AMA (Ask Me Anything) Event by Pointpay took place in Pointpay‚Äôs English Telegram channel on February 7 2023 at 18:00 CET.

For those who didn‚Äôt watch the event and of course for every visitor that would like to find rich information for BitcoinZ we have gathered all the questions and answers in this post. Additionally you can find useful links, informative material and charts that are related with each answer.

1) Please introduce yourself and tell us a little bit about the team behind BitcoinZ

Hello! We areBitcoinZProject‚Äôs ambassadors.

BitcoinZhas several different teams of volunteers who work for different aspects of the Project.¬† We use mostly nicknames all these years because the communication platforms that we mostly use are Discord & Telegram. There many new people appear every week and some of them are jumping into our teams making the project‚Äôs development increasingly interesting and decentralized.

BitcoinZ has:

‚Äì a team of people working mostly ascore developersincluding members like Marcelus, Cryptorex, Nedbear and Gra.

‚Äì a team withextra developerswho contribute to the project‚Äôs ecosystem like Cipi, Finiix, Rizzman, Richards, Jeremy and many others.

‚Äì a team of people who take care ofmarketinglike contacting platforms that are interested in listing BitcoinZ or other Projects for collaborations including members like Chad, Rok, Chancefx, NuCash

‚ÄìGraphics, Web Designing & Social media teamsincluding members like EzzyG, Pancrypto, iSatBir, Monobody, Dio & Vandar and of course many important members incommunity manager & moderator teamsthat we would take paragraphs to mention üôÇ

Join our amazing Community and take action with us by using this Discord Invitation!

2) Would you mind explaining what BitcoinZ is and what you are trying to accomplish with it?

As you can probably already started to realize from the answer to question 1 (with the so many team members *laughing* )BitcoinZ is a really Community Driven Cryptocurrency Network, and all its people together is its absolute power. It is following theProof of Workmodel soevery coin of the supply is created 100% by the mining procedure.

The Project‚Äôs motto is‚ÄúIn Decentralization We Trust‚Äù.BitcoinZwas launched by anonymous founders as a gift to the world.

There is no company behind BitcoinZ. There is no founder who allocated any part of the supply into his wallet and there is no central authority!¬† We remind that this was originally the concept of the cryptocurrency idea as it was introduced by the legendary now Bitcoin : A Decentralized Network of Personal Computers that would act as alternative so that people would not need to trust 3rd parties that act as Central Authorities.

We should add here that BitcoinZ has certain immutable parameters like immutable maximum supply and emission rate with slow fair halving for its mining rewards every 4 years exactly like Bitcoin.

Obviously this is why BitcoinZ used this name on 2017 when it was launched , because it always honors the pure cryptocurrency concept in its best form.

What many people tend tomisunderstandis this : Theymistakenlythinkthat BitcoinZ has used this name because it was a Bitcoin‚Äôs chainfork (since almost all the bitcoin named assets like Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold etc are Bitcoin‚Äôs chainforks). We have to clarify thatBitcoinZ is NOT a chainfork of Bitcoin. It had its own genesis block and its own unique, independent blockchain.

Itnever gave any free coins also called ‚Äúforkdrops‚Äùto Bitcoin holders like the chainforks of Bitcoin did.

In addition,BitcoinZ never had any kind of Initial Coin Offeringand most importantly it had absolutelyZERO preminewhich means thatits founder had nothing to ‚Äúearn‚Äùbesides of really helping the Worldto have an alternative, improved, uncensored and completelyDecentralized networkforFree borderless transactionswithvirtually zero feesandstrong optional privacy.

The‚ÄúZ‚Äùnext to its name reveals some of its great improvements:

‚ÄìZkSNARKS optional privacy. The user can enjoyoptional private transactions, something that Bitcoin cannot provide since all transactions are only transparent by default.

‚ÄìZHashASIC resistant algorithm. The Project‚Äôs Community following the White Paper‚Äôs foundation principles, pioneered in keeping the mining algorithm of the project resistant to ASIC hardware. This way the average PC user can participate inBitcoinZ‚Äôs network through the mining process, receiving meaningful coin rewards without antagonizing the ASIC miners which have dominated Bitcoin‚Äôs network for many years exploiting the immutability of its mining algorithm. ASIC miners are owned only by few people and are manufactured by a couple of companies so keeping the network ASIC resistant was a huge improvement since it encourages and secures the Community‚Äôs participation in the network contributing to its Decentralization but also to the Decentralization of the coin supply‚Äôs Distribution and of the Project‚Äôs Governance.

‚ÄìZero Fees Virtually, sinceBitcoinZ is designed to handle more transactions per second than Bitcoinand with an ideal maximum supply of 21B coins (which is 1000X higher than Bitcoin‚Äôs one) and this way achieves to keep next to zero fees in its independent network.The users can send sums of $10, $1 or even cents without caring for fees. Something that of course is impossible with coins like BTC or ETH. BitcoinZ due to its wisely chosen maximum supply also offersmuch easier pricesthat don‚Äôt look like the long non-integer numbers like 0.00056831 BTC or like the long Trillion prices of most inflationary tokens, making it an easier to use crypto for everyday transactions.

There are many other improvements with BitcoinZ likeits speed, its lighter blockchain, its scalability,as its White Paper predicts upgrades for improvements that the Community needs, and many more.

Read 33 reasons explaining why BitcoinZ should be in your portfolio by pressing the following button.

3. How do you envision the Blockchain Industry advancing in the future and how do you expect to be like ?

A big part of our community consists ofcryptocurrency ideologists: People who love thepure crypto conceptand we mostly expect it to fulfill itsoriginal purpose. To offer truly Decentralized alternative networks for fast, easy, secure transactions without high fees, without border boundaries, without censorship and of course with equal rights in privacy.

Privacy is going to play a huge rolein the near Future as we have repeatedly witnessed many tries made by systemic Authorities to take everything under their control. This is why only networks that can offer true Decentralization and Privacy features will be the winners in the long term.

It would be good to make a special mention to thedangers coming from the crypto industry itself. Unfortunately, every great invention in the human history, like Fire in the first years, or Nuclear Energy in the most recent ones, can be used constructively or destructively. History repeats itself and the same happens now with the blockchain technology. Thegreediness of some fraudulent peoplewhoabuse the lack of knowledge of the most newcomersabout how cryptocurrencies and blockchains work,leads to a dramatically increasing number of cryptocurrency scams.Founders who allocate the whole supply in their pocket, paying some influencers in order toconvince people that their asset is revolutionary, they pump it, they sell its supply and they repeat the process in a never ending vicious circle.

Especially after the so called ‚ÄúDeFi‚Äù trend, launching a useless token became a matter of just a few hours. Besides, this is howwe ended up having thousands of centralized projects or even scams that pretend to be real cryptocurrencies and of course so many dead crypto projects now with many people fearing even to hear about the word ‚ÄúCryptocurrency‚Äù. Maybe this is a systemic try to destroy the idea from within using bad actors?

In any case, we have to be extremely careful, in old Communities like BitcoinZ we are doing our bestto educate and protect people, especially the newcomers.¬† Also, all the important crypto market factors like exchanges, platforms, wallet providers etc.must show some maturity and responsibilityin order to ensure that the Cryptocurrency World will not collapse from the aforementioned risks in the end.

What is the problem that your community aims to solve in the Blockchain Industry? What makes your platform unique among other platforms offering similar products?

BitcoinZ, as we described above aims to offer in the Blockchain Industry solutions in 3 different levels:

-The first and major one is acting as atrully Community Driven,Independent,Uncensored,Opento everyone,100% Fair and Decentralized Networkforfast,secure,ultra-cheaptransactions. A Networkespecially concentrated in providing PC participation and privacy options.

This is the ultimate use case for a real cryptocurrencyand what our developers are trying to always offer.

We have to underline thatall the above togethercannot be easily found in any cryptocurrency project even today with so many thousands of projects out there, since the vast majority of them are either centralized and risky or short lived.

-The second level is offering aready to work wide ecosystem by connecting and offering real use cases.

Some good examples here are theBitcoinZDEX platformand the recently launchedConnect-ZandSpace-Zfor which we can possibly have the opportunity to talk later.

‚ÄìThe third level isEducating about the blockchain technologywith the active participation of the Communityin this procedure by as many people as it is possible.This is the only way to expand the Blockchain Industry in a healthy and safe way, protecting the newcomers from potential risks and bringing more people in this new and interesting world.

We have to mention that the above is not just a theory. Our Project‚Äôs members have been quite likecrypto activistswith strong social media presence uncovering scams and informing people. Our community has deliverededucational projects like Cryptospedia providing easy to understand explanationsand articles for crypto definitions where members from all over the world can contribute actively in translation fixes with a sophisticated system that updates the site‚Äôs articles in multiple languages. Another example is our unique ‚ÄúInteractive White Paper‚Äù which is an alternative, less technical version with more simplistic design including graphics elements and QR codes for any hard to understand definitionthat are connected with educational articles. SoBitcoinZ is in practice a user-friendly projectthat tries to help the visitor of the cryptocurrency world. This is exceptionally rare as the no1 issue of most people in crypto is the lack of understanding and this is why we have an increasing number of crypto scams victims.

5) Token Burning is advantageous to any project as it allows for the control of token circulation and the provision of greater incentives to investors. Do you have a plan to burn tokens?

BitcoinZ isa mineable coin,not a token. It hasits own independent network.¬† Like it happens with Bitcoin,BitcoinZ‚Äôs maximum coin supply is immutabletogether with some other important parameters likethe emissions aka the pace with which new coins are created and distributed to the miners. There are no supply burns for BitcoinZ but we have to mention that actually having the same emission curve with the one that Bitcoin has, should be even more attractive to an investor than making supply burns to a token.

Becauseassets like BTC and BTCZ with their immutable max supply act ashedge against inflation. Investors know thatinflation is what makes printed money so weak since Central Banks have no actual stable rules set for their currency‚Äôs maximum supply.

Token burnings on the other hand most usually look like Central Bank‚Äôs arbitrary decisions.Most tokens‚Äô founders arbitrary create huge supply of Trillion, Quadrillion or even more units that allocate in their own walletswith a smart contract before selling them to the market. Their assets are not mineable and fairly distributed. Then they start playing a game of speculation with fames for coin burns or actual burns. So what?They burn somethingthatthemselves had previously created in extreme abundance(and that they can easily re-make anytime!).

For an investor, knowing that a coin like BTC is going to have 21M (and no more) units or a coin like BTCZ is going to have 21B (and no more) units created in the next 140 years of their life should bemuch more attractive.

6) The presence of competitors is an important component of any business. Which of BitcoinZ‚Äôs major competitors are the most significant? What‚Äôs the team‚Äôs plan for overtaking its competitors?

To be honest, we wish to seethe healthy partof the crypto ‚Äúindustry‚Äù asa place with plenty of space for the pure cryptocurrenciesthat offertruly decentralized networks acting as alternatives for people‚Äôs transactions. Because this kind of cryptocurrency networksare very few and they should coexistsincecentralizing everything in just a couple of ETH-like ‚Äúmotherchains‚Äùwould bedangerousand completelyagainst the original cryptocurrency concept. Already, someside effects with the legendary ETH gas fee spikesof $150+ cost per transaction or thepausesof other super hyped ‚ÄúETH-wannabe‚Äù networks are quite well known.

So we feel more like thatthe few Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency networksthat are still around,which are getting even feweror just a handful if we add as filters the privacy, the community driven character, the fair rules, and the PC mining options,don‚Äôt have the luxury to see each other as competitor. Thus, the real competitors of BitcoinZ are the unnumbered scam tokens and centralized projects that distract people from cryptocurrencies, making them think that ‚Äúcrypto‚Äù is gambling with meme tokens or paying $50 in gas fees and having 10 rug pulls weekly.

Our community‚Äôs plan for overtaking this kind of‚Ä¶ competitors is cooperating with other pure Bitcoin-like projects that share the same values and vision. Building alliances, cooperating for the development of new use cases, educating our communities and motivating people in order to be more active.

7) To build a strong and large community what strategies do you employ? Is it your belief that the power of the community will enable your project to grow? Would you be able to explain how you plan to utilize these communities as part of your platform?

We strongly believe thatCommunity is the key for success, and we could not do otherwise for a project like BitcoinZ. The positive thing is thatBitcoinZ‚Äôs foundation rules by nature inspire an average user to be more active in our Project. The fair rules, the fact that the project had no founder allocating coins in his wallet, the opportunity for everyone to mine participating to the network and receiving coin rewards, the openness of the project as literally everyone can actively take part in its development by joining the teams of volunteers, all these and many other BTCZ aspects contribute decisively in its Community‚Äôs growth. This is whyBitcoinZ is only growing for years socially.

A devil‚Äôs advocate would wonder‚Äúthen why BitcoinZ is not already in the top 100 coins?‚ÄùIndeed someone who has the opportunity to read about BitcoinZ and spends some time to discover it in practice will most likely fall in love with its Community butpeople don‚Äôt know about it even after so many years..!¬† The project has been anorganic growerbecauseit had no central authority, no free funds, no company behind it, no heavy promotion and a visitor in the Crypto Universe has too many distractions in a super noisy (and scammy) environment.

Some recent developments though have helped to make the difference and accelerate our growth even during bear periods.

BitcoinZ with the concept of Army-Z made it to be the first 100% mineable coin that can be distributed even to people who don‚Äôt have mining equipment. Our mining community donates monthly a number of coins to theCommunity Fundand a part of this coins isoffered to people who are active sociallysupporting BitcoinZ and the original cryptocurrency idea with an automated bot system in Discord.

In addition, BitcoinZ was the first cryptocurrency that implemented aDynamic Roadmap:¬† A roadmap that is not just a static plan coming from a specific closed team. It is anever-evolving Community oriented Roadmap that is enriched with the best community sub-projects and ideas. Like a puzzle of creativity that is updated every few months with theBrain-Z events,the BitcoinZ Community‚Äôs Online Meetingsthat are usually organized twice per year. In the Brain-Z Meetings the Community members can additionally see a big slide show with speakers from several teams covering every aspect and all the recent BTCZ news and even guest developers making presentations.Every friend or visitor can even interact live by writing questions that are answered in special sections of the event.

You can possibly already realize from the aforementioned thatfor BitcoinZ its community is an unbreakable and highly required part of its very existence. It is not just a typical token team‚Äôs and community‚Äôs relationship in the way that most crypto projects nowadays try to build.BitcoinZ is its community itself.

By pressing the button below you can find a list with the most recent Brain-Z live meetings.

8) Would it be possible for you to provide us with more information about your roadmap for this year and the future as well as any updates on your research and development efforts?

Our dear ladies and gentlemen who are watching this AMA are free to visit our Community‚Äôs site Getbtcz.com and check our Dynamic Roadmapon the main pageor to watch the relevantBrain-Z meeting with its analytical presentation(on 22 January 2022 ).

Most importantly, you can seethe presentation of the elements that were deliveredafter some monthslikeConnectZ.

Connect-Zis a platform, developed by our Community, that has easy to use and minimal interface. It acts as aGateway connecting the BitcoinZ ecosystem with the Binance Smart Chainandsoon with even more Blockchains.

The users can swap native BTCZ coins to wBTCZ and vice versa. As wBTCZ is named the tokenized version of BTCZ which is now available in the Binance Smart Chain. The native coins are locked and the same number of wBTCZ tokens are released in the desired address in BSC. The two assets arepegged with a 1:1 ratiobecause BitcoinZ‚Äôs max supply is immutable. In the same way, the user can swap wBTCZ back to native BTCZ in the BitcoinZ blockchain as the Gateway burns the wBTCZ token and releases the same number of BTCZ. With ConnectZ the user can easily access the benefits of two different ecosystems enjoying their advantages. In BSC, they can contribute to liquidity pools in PancakeSwap with wBTCZ , store¬† wBTCZ in popular platforms like Metamask, Exodus or even in cold wallets like Ledger.

In the native BitcoinZ blockchain they can have next to zero fees, strong privacy, PC mining, active community participation in the project‚Äôs development and many more.

Some of the future plans that are either already included or will be included in the next update of our Roadmap are:

TheDNA-Zwhich is a new generation of wallet that will support privacy even for light mobile wallets.

TheRaise-Zwhich is a fundraising platform that combines lottery tickets motivating people to participate in the procedure with future support for hosting also fundraisings of other projects.

The nextupgrade for Connect-Zwhich will add Ethereum compatible tokenized version of BTCZ and access to ETH Defi markets

TheSpace-Zwhich is a platform for task hunters and services.

Of course we should not forget that there are also other projects that might surprise us all because honestly in a heavily Decentralized environment like this of BitcoinZ nobody can ever know exactly what is currently under development by some teams. So when we are near another Community Meeting a couple of surprisingly interesting additions can arise by members who ask to cover some extra slides presenting or announcing something completely new and unknown right now.

9) Marketing is an integral part of every project. To ensure that everyone is aware of the potential of the project, what is your strategy for attracting new users and investors to BitcoinZ and maintaining them over the long run ?

Indeed, marketing has a crucial role for every project‚Äôs success. BitcoinZ‚Äôs community tries to follow a number of recipes in order to benefit from the Project‚Äôs Decentralized expansion and development.

Every about 6 months as we already mentioned we organize ourBrain-Z Community‚Äôs Online Conferencewhere we provide information for the advancements of the Project, we gather news for upcoming developments in our Ecosystem, social media news etc. There is no better way than keeping investors and members of a Community updated and giving thema platform to interact and express their point of view.

Every September, with the birthday of the Project, our graphics and social media team makesa Historical Review for the year that has passed and delivers a Yearly Calendar-like graphpresenting the most important dates and moments for the Project. The visitors and investors can easily check all the historic achievements and important things together and when these took place from the beginning. We already have release 5 such history-graphs, and we are preparing the 6th as BitcoinZ will be 6 years old the next September! (you can find all these graphs inhttps://getbtcz.com/)

BitcoinZ with the already described concept ofArmy-Zin combination with itsfair foundation rules encourages an increasingly active communitythat feels much moreresponsibleanddeterminedfor supporting the project in social media which are a major battleground for any marketing success today. Thefeelingiscompletely differentbetween a common token ‚Äúshiller‚Äù who is trying to ‚Äúpump‚Äù a token that he just bought and a BitcoinZ community member who deeply believes in the project‚Äôs pure fundamentals and knows that he contributesto its network, to its development etc. This is why BitcoinZ despite the fact that is still low in CoinMarketCap and not especially popular yet, has a significantly active community that only grows for so many years.

At last but not least, our marketing teams try to increasingly implement marketing strategies that can contribute to better results and highest popularity for BitcoinZ.Press releaseswithinformative articles, Strong Presence inCoinMarketCap Community‚Äôs beta platform, Rich eye-catchingartworks and mini videos exclusively designed for BitcoinZ,Special eventslike Meme and Trading Competitions,YouTube Contentbuilding,SEO specialistsworking for better BitcoinZ-related results are only some examples.

10) In what ways does your token benefit users and what are its full potential uses?

As we previously explained, BitcoinZ isa coinso it not limited in providing just a specific function like most tokens do,most usually even copying the very same function.

BitcoinZ is a working real crypto ‚Äúproduct‚Äùand somethingmuch biggersince it is among the very few truly Decentralized Cryptocurrency Networks in every level offering alreadya wide range of advantages and unlimited opportunitiesfor its ecosystem‚Äôs future.

Offering aworldwide,independent,Community DrivenPC networkwith alight blockchain,fair rules,immutable maxsupply and emissions, virtuallyzero fees, strongoptional privacyanduncensoredborderlesstransactionsis the ultimate use casethat unfolds a number of more other use cases.

For example, BITCOINZ can be used as astore of value in the long termby those who truly believe in the crypto concept because it is among the classic networks with immutable parameters associated with its supply.¬† This enables it to function as ahedge against inflationlike Bitcoin, Litecoin etc

As an extension to the above, BitcoinZ can be also used as astore of savings coming from PC equipmentas well. With the user not needing to even buy the asset because he or she canjust use their PC systems for supporting the networkwith themining procedure and receiving meaningful coin rewards which can have dramatically higher value over time with higher BTCZ popularity. This is impossible to happen with tokens since they are not mineable or with assets like BTC or ZCASH which are dominated by ASIC miners that only few companies manufacture making PC mining practically impossible.

BitcoinZ‚Äôs users can use it for small sums of payments without losing any significant percentage of the transaction for paying fees. This opens a wide range of extra use cases, as BTCZ already earns increased acceptance by a number of users who use tipping bot systems like tip.cc and royal swap. I remind that moving $1 as BTC or ETH is almost impossible, and even with more modern coins like BNB or its tokens can be quite expensive. BitcoinZ solves that.

Below you can see how the user is able in practice to send a sum of just 16 cents paying virtually zero fees. Even with 100000X increased network traffic or BTCZ‚Äôs value the transaction cost would be a small fraction of a dollar‚Äôs cent.

BitcoinZ‚Äôs privacy features makes it ideal for situations where the users are in danger and have to send a sum under emergency situations. The recent revolutions in countries with totalitarian regimes are a perfect example for this. A BTC or token user that would like to help a revolting friend who is in need, by sending funds, could possiblyput him in danger with a transparent transaction. AZK-snarks¬† private transactionwould benext to impossibleto be detected by the country‚Äôs dictators.Same happens forprivate messagesthat can be potentially sent with strong encryption using BTCZ‚Äôs technology.

Of course the targeted & more specialized real use cases are also there for BitcoinZ.

For exampleSpace-Z, is a recently launched platform for task hunters and small businesses by the BitcoinZ community.The visitors of Space-Z¬† can either complete tasks or ask for the completion of a series of tasks or order a needed task for their business.

Space-Z was designed for easiness and openness. You have to justjoin the SpaceZ Discord Serverand you can instantly start collecting rewards bycompleting tasksor tocustomize an order for a task that your business needs!

All payments are made in BTCZ coins by a sophisticated bot systemthat checks screenshot proofs and approves the pre-defined payments. The user can move his coins in a wallet to his liking from his in Discord wallet that is automatically generated & connected to his Discord account.

With Space-Z small businesses will be able to easily get access to an increasing number of highly customizable services and people from all around the World will have the opportunity to earn some extra income by completing a number of easy daily tasks.¬† All these using the BitcoinZ network for their transactions!

Youtubers that would like to see their channels growing organically, company profiles that wish to increase their social media interactions, small businesses which need better scores in search engines, cryptocurrency projects that need some extra help in specific scenarios are just some examples of the Space-Z & BTCZ use cases.
