Right now in the cryptocurrency world, it’s a common secret that BITCOINZ is getting “hotter” among the low capitalization crypto projects. Low cap for now, because in this world a low cap project can climb in the top places with a very fast pace. There are many success stories of coins that jumped in the top100 places in just a few months if not even weeks. Blink and you miss it!

So how BITCOINZ gained popularity for PC mining?

The BITCOINZ project, supported by a community ofcryptocurrencypurists and ideologists, has pioneered in keeping the fundamentals that a realcryptocurrencyshould have :

1. Completely fair start with Nopremine, NoIco sales, Noinstamine

This fact attracts the minersmore than anything else. In simple words: the wholecoin supplyof BITCOINZ is distributed to the world community through themining procedure.

In contrast with other projects that act as central authorities, distributing a big part or evenallof their coin supply to their founders who sell it in the market!

2.ASICresistantalgorithm, blocking the mining “elites” from the network

Another huge advantage of the BITCOINZ project, as it protects the “small” miners and offers meaningful rewards to those who support its network. In networks that acceptASIC miners, the common PC owners actually are unable tominebecause of the competition against the mining monster companies withASICs. The BITCOINZ community’s  high priority is to use ASIC resistantmining algorithmsin order to support PC mining. Thecoin supplyof a real crypto should be distributed to all the people offering them freedom, not to a closed elite.

3. Immutablemaximum coin supply& slow, fairhalving plan

BITCOINZ is a Bitcoin-like,deflationary asset. Itsmax supplyis immutable and itshalving planif fair and slow every 4 years so that everyone has time to join its network. In other words, BITCOINZ’smining rewardsare reducing slowly over time, making it more valueable because of the deflation. But without fast speculative halvings in order to make a closed group of people rich. It is designed to help everyone who wishes to join its network, offering a purecryptocurrencysolution for virtually free transactions.

4. Insanely low, next to zero fees

People whomineother cryptocurrencies often face the problem of high fees. When they try to even transfer a sum they see a percentage of their coins spent as fees. BITCOINZ’s fee model and supply are designed so that the user can enjoyalmost zero fees, with a fraction of the dollar’s cent. This way the user can send even small sums like $1 without the fear of the transfer fees. Just for comparison,  BTC transfer fees can touch $35 or even more while an ETH token can have over over $170 fees.

5. Community Driven, Friendly, Fast, Private

BITCOINZ isreally community driven, with no company behind it and no founder taking the lion’s share out of its supply. Everyone who joins itsDiscord Channelimmediately understands that. Since it is full with positive energy and friendly people who help each other and try their best to make the project more popular. They work for projects likeCryptospedia.comthat educate people in order to avoid scams in the risky Cryptocurrency landscape. In addition, BITCOINZ is a really fast coin with strong optionalprivacybased on theZero-Proof Knowledge cryptography.

The outcome : BITCOINZ is magnetizing people’s interest

The outcome of all the aforementioned is exactly this: BITCOINZ is magnetizing people’s interest as it reminds the first period of the classic BITCOIN.

Everyone who discovers thiscryptocurrency gem, sticks with it because he feels asan active partof its network and of the Project in general. Not as an investor buying a stock like with the countless “crypto” scams.

This was the cryptocurrency idea about after all. Wasn’t it? Tomake people free from companieswithout the need to trust any central authority. With a fair and trulydecentralizedtransaction network.
