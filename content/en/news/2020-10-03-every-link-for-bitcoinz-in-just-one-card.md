We have gathered many useful links for BitcoinZ in just one mega card!

Of course it would take many more such cards in order to contain every part of the BitcoinZ ecosystem. We tried to concentrate mainly in the social media and Communication section.

So you will be able to find here some of the most popular social media profiles of the Community, the two main sites of the Project, the BTCZ Rocker’s Radio , the BTCZ  Announcement link in the legendary Bitcointalk forum and some more.

Please take in mind that for a really Decentralized Project like BitcoinZ it’s virtually impossible to list all the Community profiles as there are many members that work really hard in order to keep the world informed about BTCZ.

You can discover many more in your favourite social media app!
