An overall bullish cryptocurrency market and a combination of recent events has resulted to a highly increased social media activity aroundBitcoinZ

Specifically :

– theBlockfolio Signalsystem which spreads the Community news to a wider audience.

– theCoinmarketcapnew tags for BITCOINZ recognising its functionality for transactions, anonimity with zk-snarks and education.

– theCryptospediaarticles that help more people to understand cryptocurrency definitions.

– new BTCZ Community Social media profiles inLinkedin,Instagram,Pinterest, TikTok &Floyxplatforms that attract new members.

– the upcominghalvingon September when BITCOINZ closes 4 years of life. This reduces the remaining time for the “big” 12500 coins rewards perblock. Bitcoinz is a deflating asset like the Classic Bitcoin. It has a fixed and immutable maximum supply and an ever reducing pace of new coins in the market.

–importantly :the fact that BitcoinZ has the most fair rules in the whole Cryptospace , remaining unbound and loyal to its foundation for years. It was launched with NOpremine, NOICO sales, NOinstamine, NOdevelopers taxes. In addition, the project protected the miners community from theASICSand it has a slow , non speculative reward halving for the mining rewards , exactly like BTC , every 4 years.

All these, combined with hard work and support of its ever growing community had some great results. Stay tuned for more positive news soon!
