All the Community members that took part in the voting procedure upvoted theproposal!

This was a historical event for the BITCOINZ Community as there was a long one-month period for discussion and voting.

Obviously the proposal for the utilization ofÂ  the VaultZ Funds, was very well-presented and documented. This resulted to a very positive reaction by the whole Community. Everyone wishes to see the future VaultZ funds being automatically used in certain sectors like development, marketing and Community rewards instead of being stagnant.

More news coming soon !
