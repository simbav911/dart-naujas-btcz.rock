BITCOINZ is skyrocketing! Despite the recent bloodbath for the most cryptocurrencies, BTCZ is among the top gainers with a record 24h volume of more than  $ 1,000,000.

The coin attracted  many new buyers and enters a very “hot” period with its Community gaining new members every day

Which are the reasons behind this extreme move ?

1) The fact that BITCOINZ is atrue crypto assetthat acts asa hedge against inflation.

This comes in total constrast with the “trending” Defi platforms. The Defi platforms that recently became viral in the cryptocurrency world, have aninflativeeffect as they make the creation of new (mostly scam) tokens extremely easy. These tokens became too many and are all depending on centralized heavily premined blockchains. For example ETH is a 70% premined project with gas fees that touch numbers of even $170 dollars or higher and aconstantly increasingmax supply.

BitcoinZ had no central authority issuing or distributing coins according to a founder’s wish (noICO sales, nopremine) and has a fixedmaximum supplythat will never change. It fulfills this way for more than 4.5 years all the five fundamentals that define the very essence of a realcryptocurrency.

Therefore it’s inevitable to gain the interest over time from people who suffered by  speculative short-lived “projects” or scam exits. Because in these cases only a few founders control the supply, there is no mining, no Decentralization and only tokens that have been arbitrarily allocated to specific addresses.

2)The upcomingZBRAIN meetingon 22-January-2022

The Z-BRAIN is the on-line conference that the BITCOINZ Community organizes every 6 months in order to present the recent news, the social media reach of the Project and the future plans. Especially in the upcoming meeting, an updated Dynamic Roadmap for 2022-2023 is going to be presented with an even bigger Development team for BITCOINZ.

3)Thehalvingthat took place a couple of months ago.

This (halving) is the deflationary mechanism of the pure cryptocurrency networks that reduce the coin emissions like it happened with the classic BITCOIN in the past.

Thus, for BITCOINZ the “big” 12500 coins rewards perblockhave already been recuded to the half so it is now harder to gain new BITCOINZ coins frommining.

The halving event usually pushes the price to higher value for a coin with immutable coin supply in contrast with the printed money (FIAT) that suffer from inflation with questionable rules.

4)The multiple reasons that make BITCOINZ a unique choice.

People feel much safer with a well-established,Community driven, cryptocurrency network with fair rules that offers a wide range of important use cases.
