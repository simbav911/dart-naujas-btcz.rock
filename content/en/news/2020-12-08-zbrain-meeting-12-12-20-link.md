What is ZBrain?

Zbrain is the online conference of the BitcoinZ Community. It is organized every 3 months and everyone is free to join them.

With Zbrain, everyone can learn about the recent advancements of the BTCZ Ecosystem and the future plans of the Project. Additionally, the visitor can interact with members of the Community and the development team.

Obviously, ZBrain plays a critical rolefor BitcoinZ. Because the BitcoinZ Project is a really Democratized and Decentralized one,100% driven by its Community.  It hasn’t any company structure and the Community’s work and feedback is necessary for its expansion.
