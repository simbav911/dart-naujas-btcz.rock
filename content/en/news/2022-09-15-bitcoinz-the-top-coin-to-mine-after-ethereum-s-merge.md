The so called Ethereum’s “Merge” is here.Ethereum,  the currently most popular mineable Proof of Work cryptocurrency network, is switching to the Proof of Stake protocol for a series of reasons so it ceases to be “mineable” by Computers.

Right now there are thousands of miners who strongly believe in the Proof of Work protocol and Decentralization which are the pillars of the original cryptocurrency idea. They now wonder which cryptocurrency network they should join after Ehereum with their PCs. A quite difficult decision as we have unnumbered projects in a chaotic Crypto World.Hopefully there are some filters that can help us to separate the top options.

So which are the most profitable coins to mine according to Whattomine platform ?

2) Which crypto among them has the potential for highest gains in the future ?In which network you can gain more coins right now ?

Which cryptocurrency has the potential for the highest gains in the future ?

This is the most important aspect for a miner and combined with the aforementioned, it can make a huge difference for a miner’s gains in the long term. In the world of cryptocurrencies it’s very usual to see an extreme “hype” from several groups of people, the so called “shilling” with which they try to create an excitement about a crypto for upcoming huge gains.However mathematics are relentless and every price scenario for each asset has to be well documented, based on numbers like the current valuation, the supply for each asset and of course on their fundamentals and certain events.A recent popular example of a meaningless “shilling” wave was the “fame” that Luna (today Luna Classic -LUNC), after its price crash from $120 to fractions of $ cents, was going to regain a value between $10 to $50. These “influencers” were intentionally hiding the fact that LUNC hadn’t a fixed maximum supply ! So with its “new” current 6,904,017,889,662 supply, even a price of $0.01 is a next to impossible scenario as it would lead this questionable “crypto” to the third place in the list of the most precious crypto.This wave of shilling led and still leads many unsuspected buyers to consider LUNC as a “bargain”! They spend funds in order to get an extremely overvalued and useless token that has huge risk to fall and very limited potential for any future gains.

So how we can effectively calculate the potential gains for each asset among the most profitable to mine ?

Why BitcoinZ is still so undervalued ?

BitcoinZ is still so undervalued for a series of reasons :

– BitcoinZ has been listed in 13 exchanges but the major exchanges have not listed it yet.In contrast, Ravencoin, Flux and BitcoinGold have been listed in almost all major exchanges like Binance, Kucoin, Huobi, Gate.io, Crypto.com, Bittrex.

But how competitive is BitcoinZ against the other assets ?

In addition to the aforementioned analysis that is based on pure mathematics and facts, BitcoinZ is a superb choice for these reasons:

a) BitcoinZ exists for longer time than the other 4 assets of the comparison and it is a classic crypto with long presence as it was founded on September 2017

b) BitcoinZ is the epitome of the original cryptocurrency idea with the most fair rules and 100% Decentralized in every level : Network, Governance and Coin distribution

c) BitcoinZ offers ZK-snarks optional privacy, ASIC resistant algorithm for PC-mining, next to zero fees and immutable fixed maximum supply

d) It has a pure history without any company or founder censoring its network or any event that could be considered as a “red” or even “yellow” card.

In contrary:

Bitcoin Gold is a premined chain fork of Bitcoin, it fork-dropped free coins (a huge part of its supply) to all the bitcoin holders during its launch.

Ravencoin faced a well known hack incident with more than extra 315Million RVN coins created into circulation but hopefully made it to get listed in popular exchanges due to connections of its Community with major exchanges. Despite the fact that it was launched 5 months after BitcoinZ, copying many BTCZ elements.

Flux had a premine and its original supposed max fixed supply was 210M coins. But this was more than doubled to 440M some months ago, in practice canceling the definition of the word “maximum” and some of the very basic elements of the original crypto idea itself.

Ergo has a defined tax from its launch and it is much younger than the rest of the presented assets but regardless this fact there are much fewer coins available to be mined because it favored its early miners with a speculative halving curve and cannot convince for its fair rules.

For all the above BitcoinZ is not only competitive, but actually is the optimum choice and at the same time the most undervalued with the best potential for future gains. A rare coincidence that forms a great opportunity for both miners and buyers now.
