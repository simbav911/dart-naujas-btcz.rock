A cryptocurrency fork is a critical update to a network's protocol that makes existing rules either valid or invalid. Sometimes this procedure may result in "independent" and new versions of a cryptocurrency. Usually with the "Fork" definition we mean a hard fork.

   - Optional upgrade
   - Maintains compatibility

## Reasons for Forks
