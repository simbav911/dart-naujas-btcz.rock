The root problem with conventional currencies is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.

## What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin(â‚¿) was launched in 2008-2009 and it is the first digital coin that solved the double-spending problem without requiring a trusted authority or central server. It introduced a revolutionary technology called blockchain and proved that we can have a decentralized currency that is not controlled by banks or governments.

## Key Features

1. **Decentralization**: No central authority controls Bitcoin
2. **Limited Supply**: Only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist
3. **Transparency**: All transactions are public on the blockchain
4. **Security**: Protected by advanced cryptography
5. **Borderless**: Can be sent anywhere in the world

## Historical Significance

Bitcoin represents a technological breakthrough that has:
- Introduced blockchain technology to the world
- Sparked a revolution in financial systems
- Created a new asset class
- Inspired thousands of other cryptocurrencies

## Bitcoin's Impact

Bitcoin has demonstrated that:
- Money can function without government control
- Transactions can be secure without banks
- Value can be transferred globally without intermediaries
- Digital scarcity is possible

This pioneering cryptocurrency paved the way for projects like BitcoinZ, which builds upon Bitcoin's foundation while adding important features like privacy and true decentralization.
