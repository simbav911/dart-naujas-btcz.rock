In the Cryptocurrency world, the block reward (or mining reward) is the number of coins that are given as reward to the miner that first "found" the next block by solving a mathematical puzzle. The whole procedure of finding the next block in a cryptocurrency blockchain is called mining.

## Understanding Mining

Mining serves several crucial purposes:
1. Verifies and processes transactions
2. Secures the network
3. Creates new coins
4. Maintains decentralization

## Block Rewards

The block reward system:
- Incentivizes miners to secure the network
- Distributes new coins fairly
- Controls the rate of new coin creation
- Ensures network decentralization

## Reward Halving

Reward halving is a mechanism where:
- The block reward is cut in half at predetermined intervals
- Reduces the rate of new coin creation over time
- Creates scarcity and controls inflation
- Follows a predictable schedule

## Example in BitcoinZ

BitcoinZ follows a halving schedule where:
- Block rewards are reduced by 50% periodically
- This creates a predictable supply curve
- Helps maintain long-term value
- Prevents excessive inflation

## Mining Requirements

To participate in mining, you need:
1. Mining hardware (CPU, GPU, or ASIC)
2. Mining software
3. A wallet to receive rewards
4. Connection to a mining pool (optional but recommended)

Mining is a fundamental aspect of most cryptocurrencies, providing both network security and a fair distribution mechanism for new coins.
