# BitcoinZ Transparency & Our Use of Privacy-Respecting Ads

At BitcoinZ, we believe in true decentralization—one free of donations, blockchain taxes, or hidden fees. To sustain our community initiatives, we've chosen to display non-intrusive, privacy-respecting ads through Anonymous Ads (A-ADS). Here's what makes our approach both ethical and effective:

## Community-Powered Funding

- **No Taxes or Donations**: Ad revenue fully supports our educational resources, marketing efforts, and outreach programs—all approved by community vote.

## Respectful User Experience

- **Minimal Ads**: We limit ourselves to three ads per page.
- **Seamless Placement**: Ads are thoughtfully positioned so they never block important content or disrupt your browsing.

## Open and Transparent

- **Real-Time Data**: Track exactly how much we earn and where funds go on our live dashboard.
- **Monthly Reports**: Get detailed breakdowns of spending on campaigns, tutorials, and global translations.
- **Community Governance**: From ad guidelines to budget allocation, every decision is driven by your votes.

## Impact of Your Support

By choosing ads over donations or taxes, you help us grow BitcoinZ each time you visit or click. Together, we can:
- Expand adoption
- Enhance user education
- Reach new communities

All while keeping BitcoinZ truly free and decentralized.
