The visitors can find it under the “NEWS” menu option as “BITCOINZ HALVING“. There they can learn more about what is a halving for a pure,mineablecryptocurrencyand why it is so important.

BITCOINZ is among thevery few realcryptocurrencies thathave never acted as a central authority.Since it is 100% Community driven and hasn’t ever issued any coins, distributing them to any founders addresses. All its coin supply is distributed only to its Community.
