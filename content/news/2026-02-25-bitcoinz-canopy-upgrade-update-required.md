**GLOBAL / INTERNET** – The BitcoinZ Community announces that the Canopy network upgrade will activate at block height 1,735,000, expected to be reached around March 14, 2026. All mining pool operators, wallet providers, and full node operators are required to update their software to BitcoinZ version 2.2.0-rc1, codenamed "BB-8," before this block height is reached.

This consensus-level upgrade is a critical milestone for the BitcoinZ network. Failure to update before block 1,735,000 will result in nodes following an incompatible chain, rendering their transactions and mining activity invalid on the main network.

## What Is the Canopy Upgrade?

The Canopy upgrade is a network consensus upgrade that introduces proper development funding through trusted locked funds with redundancy for distribution. This mechanism ensures that resources are allocated transparently and securely to support ongoing development, infrastructure maintenance, and ecosystem growth.

By implementing a structured and decentralized funding model, the Canopy upgrade represents a significant milestone for BitcoinZ's long-term sustainability. It reinforces the project's commitment to community-driven development while ensuring the resources necessary to continue building and improving the network.

## Who Needs to Update?

The following participants must update their software to version 2.2.0-rc1 (BB-8) before block 1,735,000:

- **Mining Pool Operators** – All pools mining BitcoinZ must upgrade their node software to remain on the correct chain after activation.
- **Wallet Providers** – Any service or application that operates a BitcoinZ full node must update to the new version.
- **Full Node Operators** – Anyone running a BitcoinZ full node, whether for personal use or as a service, must upgrade.

**Note:** If your wallet software has already incorporated this update into its latest release, no additional action is required on your part. Check with your wallet provider to confirm compatibility.

## Update Timeline

Immediate action is strongly recommended. The Canopy upgrade is a consensus-level change, meaning that once block 1,735,000 is reached, the network will enforce the new rules. Nodes running older versions of the software will diverge onto an incompatible fork, causing:

- Mined blocks to be rejected by the updated network
- Transactions to fail or become invalid on the main chain
- Loss of connectivity with peers running the updated software

The earlier you update, the more time you have to verify that your setup is functioning correctly on the new version.

## How to Update

The BitcoinZ 2.2.0-rc1 (BB-8) release is available for download from the official GitHub repository:

**https://github.com/btcz/bitcoinz/releases/tag/2.2.0-rc1**

Download the appropriate build for your platform, verify the release, and replace your existing BitcoinZ node binary. Restart your node to begin running the updated software.

## Important Notes

Before and after the upgrade, please take the following precautions:

- **Verify your mining pool** – Confirm that the pool you mine on has updated to version 2.2.0-rc1. Mining on a pool that has not upgraded will result in wasted hashrate after block 1,735,000.
- **Confirm wallet compatibility** – Ensure that any wallet software you use is compatible with the Canopy upgrade. Contact your wallet provider if you are unsure.
- **Consider solo mining during the transition** – Running a solo mining setup with the updated full node wallet is a reliable way to ensure you are mining on the correct chain during the transition period.

## Community Action

As a community-driven project, BitcoinZ relies on its members to help ensure a smooth network transition. You can help by:

- Sharing this announcement with mining pools that support BitcoinZ
- Notifying wallet providers and exchanges about the upcoming upgrade
- Encouraging fellow node operators to update their software promptly
- Monitoring the network after activation to confirm a successful transition

The strength of BitcoinZ lies in its community. A coordinated and timely upgrade across the network will ensure that the Canopy activation proceeds without disruption.

## Looking Ahead

The Canopy network upgrade is a significant step forward for BitcoinZ's future. By establishing a sustainable and transparent development funding mechanism, the BitcoinZ network is better positioned to support continued innovation, attract new contributors, and grow the ecosystem for years to come.

The BitcoinZ Community thanks all node operators, pool operators, wallet providers, and community members for their prompt attention to this important upgrade.
