The BITCOINZ Community is celebrating the 4 YEARS of life with the recent birthday on September 9 2021.

As always, the friends and visitors of the Project can find a history graph for the 4 YEARS ANNIVERSARY.

The diagram contains the most important moments of BITCOINZ with dates and brief description for the last year!

This kind of history diagrams is a golden standard for the BITCOINZ Community, as it takes place every year on Sept 9, increasing the transparency for the delivered development of the Project. Hence the visitors can easily have an overview of the activity for each year!
