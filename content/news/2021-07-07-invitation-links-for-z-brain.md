In these e-meetings the community members discuss the recent advancements and the measures that need to be taken in order to address any possible shortcoming. A type of announcement, containing a brief description of the topics of discussion, is always available after the Z Brain events.

ZBrain meetings take place 4 times per year in fixed dates that are announced in theBitcoinZ Discord Channelandforum. Everyone is free to join the meeting inYoutubeor Zoom!
