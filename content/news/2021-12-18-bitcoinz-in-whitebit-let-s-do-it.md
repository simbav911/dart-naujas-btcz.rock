BITCOINZ in WhiteBIT ? Yes we can make this !

Many Community members had been asking “why BITCOINZ is not listed in one of the very top exchanges?”

Of course we all know that BITCOINZ is a community driven project with no free funds coming from premine or ICO, since all its supply is distributed to the community members with the mining process.

This is why the BITCOINZ ecosystem and its user base has an organic growth without the easy but most times dirty job of influencers or other marketing tricks. Most times this leads to very surprising results, with useless tokens being advertised as something important and pure cryptocurrency networks growing silently without the top exchanges ever noticing them.

BITCOINZ has been noticed by WhiteBIT

After a wide research for a trustworthy exchange that is ranked in the very top places of the CoinMarketCap CEXes list, a team of active BTCZ community members came in contact with WhiteBIT.

WhiteBIT’s representatives offered to the BITCOINZ Community their top listing package with 9 markets, for the best available price, accepting 10% of the payment in BTCZ coins. Now a Fund raising procedure has been initiated in order to gather the $45,000 target. We are confident that we can make it because there are many BTCZ fans out there!

Why WhiteBIT?

WhiteBIT is one of the fastest growing exchanges in the crypto market. Currently ranked between the positions 30-40 and rising to only better ranks in a stable pace during the last couple of years, it is among the most promising platforms with a huge possibility to be in the very top20 exchanges the next years.

Based in Esthonia, it is a licensed crypto CEX with over500,000 users in Europe, Asia, and the CIS countries.

Around April the exchange is going to accept US-clients but already using VPN the traders can access it from USA.

New and Basic Accounts can currently withdraw 500 USD (or equivalent) per day. Enhanced Accounts: USD 100,000 (or equivalent) per day with two-factor authentication enabled. Verification is required for withdrawals that exceed 2 BTC per day.

Deposit Methods

The exchange supports 160 trading pairs with crypto and fiat, including BTC/USD, BTC/USDT, BTC/RUB, and BTC/UAH. Deposits and withdrawals are possible with Visa and MasterCard, as well as Advcash, Qiwi, Mercuryo, Geo-Pay, Interkassa, monobank and Perfect Money.

The fact that fiat currency deposits are permitted at all also makes this exchange an “entry-level exchange”, meaning an exchange where new crypto investors can take their first steps into the exciting crypto world.

WhiteBIT Security

This trading platform stores 96% of all assets in cold storage. As with most other exchanges, you can also enable two factor authentication to log in. There are also IP-detection features, biometrics confirmation and more. All in all, WhiteBIT seems to focus on security.

Positive Reviews

Most people in crypto possibly already know that building a good name in the crypto exchange industry is not the easier thing.Many clients don’t understand how to use their crypto assets. Or there are fraudulent people who write negative reviews in order to advertise “specialized services in recovering funds” etc and all these result in many negative reviews even for popular exchanges like Binance or Kucoin.

Despite this fact, WhiteBIT makes it to be among the top performers in the most reviewing platforms like TrustPilot or CryptocurrencyExchanges. At the same time it enjoys top rated reviews for its apple or android apps. These complete the image of a reputable exchange that can really partner with a pure cryptocurrency project like BITCOINZ and help it jump to the next level.

How to help with the Fund Raising?

1. You can help with the procedure by donating or even declaring what you are decided to donate, in any crypto. The project’s administrators are populating a list with all the donators.

So the best option is to please join theBITCOINZ Discord Channel and contact an admin (like Rok or Chancefx – they will never dm you first).

This list is made in order to return the donation to the users who wish in case that the project fails to raise the needed the funds.

2A. If you don’t care for getting back the funds and wish to directly donate to the project,  you can use

https://fund.btcz.rocks/

In this url you can donate BTC, LTC, ZEC, BTCZ or USDT.

2B. Alternatively if you don’t have coins but you wish todonate some hashpower, you can use 2MINERS ETHEREUM mining setup that pays out to BTC addresses automatically with next to zero fees.

Just use this commandline in the Phoenix ETH miner :

PhoenixMiner.exe -pool eth.2miners.com:2020 -wal1FtZ8DAwv4wpY2DrFadAaXqNmmXmy2Lnti-worker DonatorName -epsw x -mode 1 -Rmode 1 -log 0 -mport 0 -etha 0 -retrydelay 1 -ftime 55 -tt 79 -tstop 89 -tstart 79 -coin eth

Just add  “asia-” or “us-” with the “eth.2miners.com:2020” if you are in Asia or US respectively. For example for a US server you should have us-eth.2miners.com:2020 instead of eth.2miners.com:2020 which is EU based.

3. Soon we will possibly have a FIAT option like GoFundMe.

Even if you are unable to donate, please don’t forget to at least spread the word about this by following the BITCOINZ Community profiles and sharing the recent posts about this procedure.

Don’t forget that you do something important. You help an honest project that serves the original crypto idea for more than 4 years!

Kind Regards to every friend of the Community!
