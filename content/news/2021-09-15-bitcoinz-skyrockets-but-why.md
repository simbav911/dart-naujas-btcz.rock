BITCOINZ skyrocketed up to +77% during a negative day for the cryptocurrency market.Many people wonder why this impressive move took place.

Obviously the coin attracted many buyers and enters a very “hot” period with its Community gaining new members every day!.

Which are the reasons behind this extreme move ?

1) The fact that BITCOINZ is a deflationary asset in constrast the “trending” Defi platforms. The Defi platforms that recently became viral in the cryptocurrency world have aninflativeeffect as they make the creation of new (mostly scam) tokens extremely easy. These tokens became too many and are all depending on centralized heavily premined blockchains. For example ETH is a 70% premined project with gas fees that touch numbers of even $170 dollars or higher and aconstantly increasingmax supply.

In contrast, BitcoinZ had no central authority issuing or distributing coins according to a founder’s wish (noICO sales, nopremine) and has a fixedmaximum supplythat will never change. It fulfills this way all the five fundamentals that define the very essence of a realcryptocurrency.

2)The upcominghalvingon October.

This (halving) is the deflationary mechanism of the pure cryptocurrency networks that reduce the coin emissions like it happened with the classic BITCOIN in the past.

For BITCOINZ the “big” 12500 coins rewards perblockwill be recuded to the half so it will be even harder to gain more BITCOINZ coins frommining.

The halving event usually pushes the price to higher value for a coin with immutable coin supply in contrast with the printed money (FIAT) that suffer from inflation.

3)The organic social media expansion

The BITCOINZ social media accounts are literally on fire. The CommunityTwitter accountincreased its followers by +80% and theBITCOINZ Reddit grouphad a jump of +50% users during the last months with many posts every day.

The number of people that are online & active inBITCOINZ Redditare sometimes touching or even surpassing those of ultra popular projects like DASH !

It is raining karma in BITCOINZ Reddit! I have not seen such a high activity from same size Communities again! – Twitter

Most importantly, it is widely known that BITCOINZ social media accounts haveonly real followers. Exactly this is why everyone who joins theBTCZ Discordchat  is falling in love with the BITCOINZ Community. Team spirit and human relations are very rare elements in the cryptocurrency world but very common for the BITCOINZ people!

In contrary, other “crypto” communities that tend to present extreme social numbers withfake botfollowers. These bots of course never interact with anyone and the visitor rightfully feels that he has joined another ghost “scammy” project.

4)The popularity of the project in several places of the worldwhere people start adding real use cases for the coin.

An example is India where the Community organized an amazing birthday party for BITCOINZ!

The project celebrates its4 YEARS ANNIVERSARYand this is another important factor that acts very positively. Because people feel much safer with a well-established,Community driven, cryptocurrency network with fair rules than with the countless new token projects.

More and more companies in India start to implement BITCOINZ accepting it for payments.

A perfect example isVibhaa technologies, a rapidly growing software company located inPuttur, Karnataka. India Developers  have joined the BitcoinZ Project with great aspirations! These developers are building a vast network and infrastructure inside India with huge community support.

Another example of great Community support is theSoupru Services TVwhich is an emerging cryptocurrency group with growing popularity in french speaking African countries. This group is increasingly covering the BITCOINZ project with video material explaining its potential.

At last but not least, the Cryptospedia team has launched a brand newYouTube channeltargeting the english speaking people. This team is building every week high quality video material explaining cryptocurrency definitions, giving helpful safety tips and presenting mining guides for BITCOINZ and other projects.
