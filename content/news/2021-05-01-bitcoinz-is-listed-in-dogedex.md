BITCOINZ is listed in DOGEDEX ! After a huge vote win against SafeMoon, Hoge and Polkadex, the BITCOINZ Community can enjoy this superb app with DEX functionality!

What is DOGEDEX exactly?

DOGEDEX is an innovative application that acts as wallet with integrated DEX functionality using doge as one of its basic digital currencies.

In reality the user can enjoy a modern wallet app , owning his keys for every asset and at the same time atrue 100% Decentralized Exchangethat enables the users totrade directly (P2P)between them.

Utilizing the Komodo’s atomic swap technology, it is among the very few DEX platforms that give swapping functionality between (potentially)allthe unique UTXO blockchainsandthe eth  tokens or other tokenizing ecosystems.

The aforementioned doesn’t happen with the most popular DEX platforms. Because they usually offer swapsonly between tokenized coins in a specific ecosystemthat all depend on the same blockchain. Namely “wrapped” coins which take a specific “compatible” form in order to function in a certain ecosystem. Exactly like wBTC or wZCASH do for the ETH ecosystem for example. This common “DEX” approach leads to a centralized model that is very far from the pure cryptocurrency idea. With extra disrtortions like fee spikes because everything is over one certain blockchain. (maybe you already know about the crazy ETH gas fees).

On the  contrary,  the DOGEDEX platform achieves to make the swaps betweenALLthese different ecosystems and other unique blockchains like those of Bitcoin, Digibyte, BitcoinZ, Dogecoin, Litecoin etc. Without of course the requirement to “wrap” a coin into a specific blockchain before the transaction!

You can imagine that the DOGEDEX  is something like awormhole/gateway through all the listed blockchainsand each blockchain is like a parallel universe. So with this application the trading between these parallel universes is finally achievable!

What are the user’s benefits actually ?

The benefits for a DOGEDEX user are :

– Adouble functionalityapp which is a greatwalletwith decentralizedexchangefeatures.

You can sell a coin for another, so you are a seller/maker. Or you can fulfill an existing selling order because you wish to buy a coin paying with another one that you have in your wallet! In this case you are a buyer/taker. Very simple!

–Increased securitybecauseyou own your keysand you trade from your wallet.

There areno 3rd partieswith 3rd addresses like with the Centralized exchanges. So the associated risks are totally eliminated. Risks like exchanges that got hacked, scam exits, sneaky delistings and loss of funds etc are a past.

–Decreased transactions cost.

With no 3rd parties there areno withdrawal feesanymore because there are no withdrawals! Any traded coins are coming directly in your wallet when the atomic swap is completed. Even the fees are minimal in the atomicDEX. Only the taker (buyer) pays a 0.15% on the traded sum.

– Significantlyfaster trading.

Without any withdrawals, there is no waiting for long confirmations so a completed trade is considerably faster! Don’t forget that a trade should never be considered truly completed if the funds are not inyourwallet. So with a true DEX this happens really faster!

–No limitation to specific trading pairs.

The user can trade with swaps between the coins of his choice. The number of the combinations is limited only by the liquidity.Every listed assetcan be swapped for another one! In the most centralized exchanges the client has to use almost always bitcoin because the most coins have only a BTC trading pair. This is increasing even more the fees and requires double transactions.

– A smooth,real DEX experiencewithrespect to the user’s privacy.

The atomicDEX platform has no long registration procedures with KYC (know your client) which usually remind Financial Institutes practices.
