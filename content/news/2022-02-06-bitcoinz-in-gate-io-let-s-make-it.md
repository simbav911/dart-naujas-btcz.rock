Gate.io, the popular major cryptocurrency exchange,is asking with its social media profile in twitter which coin to list next.

After BTCZ community’s response under this busy post, the exchange’s profile asked more information about the few projects that seemed most active and interesting.

This reaction in a chaos of countless comments was very important and surprising because BitcoinZ was among these few assets for which Gate.io expressed its interest.

Specifically, Gate.io asked “Is BitcoinZ better than Bitcoin?” attracting a new wave of answers.

It is time foran even more massive reaction to this post thathas been just retweeted by BTCZOfficial.

At the same time, the BITCOINZ Community dominated therelevant Gate.io’s post in Facebook page.

Like BitcoinZ made it recently with TradeOgre and WhiteBIT (rank35) listings, it can possibly make it with a Gate.io (rank7) listing soon.
