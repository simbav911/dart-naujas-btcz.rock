**GLOBAL / INTERNET** – The BitcoinZ Community today announces the release of BitcoinZ Blue v2.0.0, a major protocol and reliability update that significantly enhances the official light wallet's capabilities. This substantial update introduces support for amounts exceeding 21 million BTCZ, implements enhanced wallet recovery mechanisms, and delivers critical reliability improvements across all platforms.

BitcoinZ Blue v2.0.0 represents a significant evolution in the wallet's architecture, migrating to BitcoinZ-specific protocol implementations while maintaining the bulletproof security and privacy-first design that users have come to expect. The update addresses key user feedback and technical requirements identified since the initial release.

## Major Protocol Enhancements

### BitcoinZ-Specific Protocol Implementation

The most significant change in v2.0.0 is the migration to BitcoinZ-specific forks of librustzcash and orchard libraries. This critical update removes the upstream 21 million coin supply limitation, enabling proper handling of BitcoinZ's larger supply model.

**Key Protocol Improvements:**
- Support for amounts up to 21 billion BTCZ with precision mathematics
- BitcoinZ-specific Human Readable Prefixes (HRP) for key import compatibility
- Enhanced protocol compatibility for optimal BitcoinZ network performance
- Improved large-amount transaction handling with string/bigint mathematics

### Enhanced Wallet Recovery

Version 2.0.0 introduces HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) address discovery on wallet restoration, ensuring complete account recovery for users. This enhancement applies BIP44 gap rules and automatically discovers all previously used addresses during the restoration process.

**Recovery Improvements:**
- Automatic discovery of all wallet addresses during restoration
- Complete transaction history recovery
- Enhanced seed phrase restoration reliability
- Improved wallet state persistence across app restarts

## User Experience Enhancements

### Redesigned Key Management

The export modal has been completely redesigned with enhanced functionality and improved user experience:

**New Export Features:**
- Structured key list with wallet order preservation
- Individual Copy Key and Copy Line actions for each private key
- Copy All functionality for bulk operations
- Download to .txt file option for secure offline storage
- Visual copy feedback for user confirmation
- 16/16 character truncation for improved readability

### Enhanced Key Import Support

BitcoinZ Blue v2.0.0 expands key import capabilities with support for multiple formats:

- Transparent private key import (WIF K/L/5... formats)
- BitcoinZ-specific HRP support (btcz-secret-extended-key-main, btczxviews)
- Backward compatibility with Zcash-style HRPs
- Improved import validation and error handling

## Critical Reliability Fixes

### Windows Platform Improvements

Significant improvements have been made to address Windows-specific issues:

**Windows Fixes:**
- Resolved "Missing inputs" transaction errors with pre-broadcast UTXO validation
- Improved balance persistence after application restart
- Enhanced loading and recovery flow reliability
- Added comprehensive transaction diagnostics
- Fixed balance state updates and synchronization

### Cross-Platform Stability

**General Reliability Improvements:**
- Corrected zatoshis→BTCZ conversion in balance change detection
- Fixed EUR→BTCZ rounding to prevent "Too many decimals" validation errors
- Improved PIN/lock state persistence across app restarts
- Enhanced balance change detection accuracy
- Cleaned up debug logging for better performance

## Technical Architecture Updates

### Build System Enhancements

The v2.0.0 release includes significant improvements to the build and deployment pipeline:

**Build Improvements:**
- Protocol buffer compiler (protoc) installation on all CI platforms
- Architecture separation for macOS builds
- Production DevTools disabled on Windows for security
- Enhanced cross-platform compatibility testing
- Improved dependency management and version control

### Performance Optimizations

**Performance Enhancements:**
- Optimized large-amount calculations with precision mathematics
- Improved memory management for better stability
- Enhanced transaction processing efficiency
- Reduced application startup time
- Streamlined blockchain synchronization process

## Security and Privacy Maintained
