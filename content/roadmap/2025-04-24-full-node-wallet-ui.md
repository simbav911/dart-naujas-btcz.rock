# BitcoinZ Full Node Wallet UI

## Overview
A comprehensive project to develop a modern, intuitive, and feature-rich desktop wallet application that runs a full BitcoinZ node, enhancing both decentralization and user experience.

## Key Features
- **Full Node Integration**: Complete BitcoinZ node with blockchain synchronization
- **Intuitive Interface**: User-friendly design for all experience levels
- **Comprehensive Wallet Functions**: Send/receive BTCZ, transaction history, address book
- **Security Features**: Secure key management, encryption, and backup solutions
- **Advanced Capabilities**: Built-in explorer, coin control, and privacy features
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Research & Planning (25% Complete)
- Core requirements definition
- Technology stack selection (evaluating Qt, Electron, Tauri)
- Architecture design and security planning
- Project setup and team formation

### Phase 2: Design & Prototyping (Upcoming)
- User experience (UX) design with intuitive flows
- User interface (UI) design with consistent BitcoinZ branding
- Interactive prototyping and community feedback

### Phase 3: Development (Upcoming)
- Core backend integration with BTCZ daemon
- Frontend UI implementation
- Advanced feature development
- Security implementation
- Cross-platform build system

### Phase 4: Testing & Quality Assurance (Upcoming)
- Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, functional)
- Security audit
- Community alpha/beta testing program
- Performance optimization

### Phase 5: Launch & Release (Upcoming)
- Documentation and installer preparation
- Official release through BitcoinZ channels
- Initial support and monitoring

### Phase 6: Maintenance & Enhancement (Ongoing Plan)
- Regular updates and bug fixes
- New feature implementation based on community feedback
- Continued support and documentation

## Technical Approach
The wallet will leverage modern frameworks while ensuring efficient communication with the BitcoinZ daemon. Security is prioritized throughout development, with special attention to private key handling and encryption.

## Community Benefits
- **Enhanced Decentralization**: More full nodes strengthen the BitcoinZ network
- **Improved Accessibility**: Easier onboarding for new users
- **Greater Security**: Reduced reliance on third-party services
- **Feature Expansion**: Platform for implementing advanced BTCZ capabilities

## Current Status
Phase 1 (Research & Planning) is 100% complete, with technology evaluation and architecture design finalized. The project is now entering the Design & Prototyping phase, with an overall completion of 25%.

Expected completion timeline: Q4 2025
Status: 25% Complete
