BITCOINZ is a minable digital coin which is using Zhash, an ASIC resistant algorithm. This way it protects the miners community so that virtually everyone is able to use his hardware in order to mine BITCOINZ and support its network.

## A Few Words About Mining & Mining Pools

For a miner, the probability of finding a block is equal to their portion of the total hashrate (mining power) on the network. This means that the miners with a small percentage of the mining power stand a very small chance of discovering the next block on their own.

Mining pools are created to solve this problem. Mining pools are gathering / pooling of resources, by miners who share their processing power over a network. These pools are splitting the reward equally among everyone in the pool, according to the amount of work they contribute to the pool and as a result to the probability of finding a block. With this model, every miner, smaller or bigger, earns a specific number of shares and gets a percentage of the block reward when the pool is finding the next block.
