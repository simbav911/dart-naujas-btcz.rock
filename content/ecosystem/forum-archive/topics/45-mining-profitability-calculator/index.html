                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
                    
                    <p>I've been working on a simple mining profitability calculator for BitcoinZ and wanted to share it with the community. This should help miners determine if mining BTCZ is profitable for their specific setup.</p>
                    
                    <p>You can access the calculator here: <a href="https://btcz-calc.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">https://btcz-calc.herokuapp.com/</a></p>
                    
                    <p>The calculator takes into account:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your hashrate (in Sol/s)</li>
                        <li>Power consumption (in watts)</li>
                        <li>Electricity cost (in USD/kWh)</li>
                        <li>Pool fee (%)</li>
                        <li>Current network difficulty</li>
                        <li>Current BTCZ price</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>It then calculates your estimated daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly earnings in both BTCZ and USD, as well as your power costs and net profit.</p>
                    
                    <p>The calculator automatically fetches the current network difficulty and BTCZ price, but you can also manually adjust these values if you want to run projections based on different scenarios.</p>
                    
                    <p>Please let me know if you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvements!</p>

                    <p>This is great! I just tried it with my setup (6x GTX 1070s) and the numbers seem accurate based on my actual mining results.</p>
                    
                    <p>One suggestion: Could you add an option to input hardware costs so we can calculate ROI (return on investment) timeframes?</p>

                    <p>@MiningExpert - Thanks for the feedback! That's a great suggestion. I'll add a hardware cost input field in the next update so users can see their estimated ROI timeframe.</p>
                    
                    <p>For anyone else who tries the calculator, here are some typical hashrates for common GPUs mining BitcoinZ (Equihash algorithm):</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>GTX 1050 Ti: ~180 Sol/s</li>
                        <li>GTX 1060 6GB: ~300 Sol/s</li>
                        <li>GTX 1070: ~450 Sol/s</li>
                        <li>GTX 1080: ~600 Sol/s</li>
                        <li>GTX 1080 Ti: ~750 Sol/s</li>
                        <li>RX 470/480 4GB: ~260 Sol/s</li>
                        <li>RX 570/580 8GB: ~300 Sol/s</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>These are approximate values and can vary based on your overclock settings and system configuration.</p>

                    <p>This calculator is really helpful! I'm just getting started with mining and was trying to figure out if my gaming PC could profitably mine BitcoinZ when I'm not using it.</p>
                    
                    <p>One question: The calculator shows I'd make about 50 BTCZ per day with my GTX 1060. How long does it typically take for pools to pay out? Do most pools have a minimum payout threshold?</p>

                    <p>@NewMiner - Most BitcoinZ pools have minimum payout thresholds ranging from 0.01 BTCZ to 1 BTCZ, depending on the pool. With a GTX 1060 generating ~50 BTCZ per day, you'd hit even the highest thresholds within a day.</p>
                    
                    <p>As for payout frequency, it varies by pool:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Some pools pay automatically once you hit the threshold</li>
                        <li>Others pay on fixed schedules (every hour, every 4 hours, etc.)</li>
                        <li>A few pools only pay manually when you request it</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>I recommend Equipool or Miningspeed for beginners. Both have low minimum payouts (0.01 BTCZ) and automatic payments.</p>

                    <p>@Bitcoinzer - Great calculator! One thing to consider adding is a difficulty trend projection. The current difficulty is just a snapshot, but mining profitability is heavily influenced by how difficulty changes over time.</p>
                    
                    <p>Based on the data I've been tracking, BitcoinZ difficulty has been increasing by approximately 5-8% per week. This means that if all other factors remain constant (price, hashrate, etc.), your mining rewards will decrease by 5-8% each week.</p>
                    
                    <p>Perhaps you could add an optional "Estimated weekly difficulty increase %" field that would show projected earnings over time with the difficulty adjustment factored in?</p>

                    <p>Thanks for all the feedback everyone! I've updated the calculator with the following new features:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Added hardware cost input for ROI calculations</li>
                        <li>Added difficulty increase projection (you can set the % weekly increase)</li>
                        <li>Added a "Compare GPUs" feature where you can see profitability for different hardware side by side</li>
                        <li>Added more preset configurations for common GPUs</li>

                    <p>@DataAnalyst - Thanks for the suggestion about difficulty projections. I implemented it and it definitely gives a more realistic picture of long-term profitability.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm planning to add a few more features in the coming weeks:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Historical difficulty chart</li>
                        <li>Price trend projections</li>
