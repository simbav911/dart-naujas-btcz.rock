                    <p>Hello BTCZ community,</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm trying to compile a comprehensive list of all exchanges that currently list BitcoinZ. This would be really helpful for newcomers to the community who are looking to buy or trade BTCZ.</p>
                    
                    <p>So far, I know of the following exchanges:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Crex24</li>
                        <li>Graviex</li>
                        <li>STEX</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Are there any others that I'm missing? Also, if you have experience with any of these exchanges, could you share your thoughts on which ones provide the best experience for trading BTCZ in terms of:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Liquidity</li>
                        <li>Fees</li>
                        <li>Ease of use</li>
                        <li>Withdrawal process</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p>

                    <p>You've got the main ones, but there's also:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Exrates</li>
                        <li>Stocks.Exchange (though they've been having some issues lately)</li>

                    <p>In my experience, Crex24 has the best liquidity for BTCZ at the moment, and their fees are reasonable. Withdrawals have always been processed quickly for me.</p>

                    <p>Don't forget about TradeSatoshi! They've listed BTCZ for a while now.</p>
                    
                    <p>As for my experiences:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Crex24</strong>: Good liquidity, reasonable fees (0.1%), easy to use interface, quick withdrawals</li>
                        <li><strong>Graviex</strong>: Decent liquidity, slightly higher fees (0.2%), interface is a bit confusing at first, withdrawals take a bit longer</li>
                        <li><strong>STEX</strong>: Lower liquidity, higher fees (0.5%), good interface, withdrawal times vary</li>
                        <li><strong>TradeSatoshi</strong>: Very low liquidity, high fees (0.8%), basic interface, slow withdrawals</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>I personally use Crex24 for most of my BTCZ trading.</p>

                    <p>Thanks for starting this thread! It's always good to have this information in one place.</p>
                    
                    <p>Just to add to what others have said, we're currently in talks with several other exchanges for potential listings. I can't share specific names yet, but we're focusing on getting BTCZ listed on exchanges with higher volume and better user experience.</p>
                    
                    <p>One thing to note: always make sure to use the correct deposit address when sending BTCZ to exchanges. Some exchanges have had issues with deposits when users send to the wrong address type (e.g., sending to a transparent address when they should use a shielded address).</p>
                    
                    <p>We'll keep the community updated on any new exchange listings!</p>

                    <p>I'm new to BitcoinZ and just bought some on Crex24. The process was pretty straightforward, but I noticed the spread is quite wide sometimes. Is this normal for BTCZ?</p>
                    
                    <p>Also, are there any plans for getting BTCZ listed on larger exchanges like Binance or KuCoin in the future?</p>

                    <p>Thanks everyone for the responses! This is really helpful.</p>
                    
                    <p>@NewTrader - Yes, the spread can be wide at times due to the current trading volume. As more people trade BTCZ, the spread should narrow. As for larger exchanges, I believe that's definitely a goal for the team, but these listings often require significant listing fees.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'll compile all this information into a single list that we can keep updated as new exchanges are added:</p>
