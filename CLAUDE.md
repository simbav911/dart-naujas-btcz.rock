## Architecture Overview

### Hugo Site Structure
- **Content Management**: Markdown files in `content/` directory organized by language and section
- **Templating**: Hugo templates in `layouts/` with custom templates for different content types
- **Static Assets**: Images, CSS, and other assets in `static/` directory
- **Configuration**: Primary config in `hugo.toml`, theme is PaperMod

### Key Directories
- `content/`: All website content in Markdown format
  - Root level contains English content
  - Subdirectories like `news/`, `learn/`, `ecosystem/`, `wallets/`, etc.
  - Contains multilingual content structure
- `layouts/`: Hugo HTML templates
  - `_default/`: Base templates for different page types
  - Custom section templates for specialized pages
  - Partial templates in `partials/` subdirectory
- `static/`: Static assets (images, CSS, favicons)
  - `css/`: Custom CSS files for styling
  - `images/`: All image assets organized by category
- `data/`: YAML data files (e.g., `partners.yaml` for partner information)
- `scripts/`: Python and JavaScript utility scripts for forum archive generation

### Content Types
- **News Articles**: Time-based content with dates in filenames
- **Educational Content**: Crypto learning materials in `learn/` section  
- **Ecosystem Pages**: Mining, wallets, exchanges, games, and developer resources
- **Static Pages**: About sections, roadmap, community information

### Styling System
- **Tailwind CSS**: Primary CSS framework with custom configuration
- **Custom Theme**: BitcoinZ branding with gold (#FFD700) and gray color scheme
- **Typography Plugin**: Enhanced text styling for content pages
- **Custom Animations**: Gradient and pulse animations defined in Tailwind config

### Multilingual Support
- English as primary language
- i18n configuration files in `i18n/` directory
- Structured to support multiple languages (Spanish, Chinese mentioned in README)

## Key Configuration Files

- `hugo.toml`: Main Hugo configuration with site settings, menu structure, and theme parameters
- `package.json`: Node.js dependencies and NPM scripts
- `tailwind.config.js`: Tailwind CSS configuration with custom BitcoinZ theme colors and animations
- `postcss.config.js`: PostCSS configuration for CSS processing
- `data/partners.yaml`: Partner and wallet information data

## Deployment

- **Target**: GitHub Pages
- **Branch**: main
- **Build**: Static files generated by Hugo
- **Domain**: getbtcz.com (configured in hugo.toml)

## Content Guidelines

When working with content:
- News articles use date-prefixed filenames (YYYY-MM-DD-title.md)
- Educational content focuses on cryptocurrency concepts and BitcoinZ-specific information
- Maintain consistent front matter structure across content types
- Images should be optimized and properly referenced in static/images/
- Follow the existing multilingual content structure when adding new content
